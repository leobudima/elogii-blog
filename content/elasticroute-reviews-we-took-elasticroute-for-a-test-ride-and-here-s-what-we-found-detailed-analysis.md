ElasticRoute is a route-planning platform mostly known for its integration with Detrack – a delivery management solution.

However, ElasticRoute has a stand-alone version as well, which we’ll review in this blog.

We’ll dissect ElasticRoute’s:

* Ease of use
* Key features
* Pricing
* Best use cases

This way, you’ll know whether this software is right for your business.

And if it’s not, there’s nothing to worry about – we’ll suggest an alternative option, too.

## TLDR

* ElasticRoute is a very basic yet easy-to-navigate route planning platform with some elementary route optimization features
* This tool does little more than plan routes by itself, but its integration with Detrack can provide users with a more comprehensive delivery management system
* ElasticRoute has a free-forever plan that isn’t a good choice for most businesses due to its many limitations
* Its per-vehicle pricing and the lack of more sophisticated features make ElasticRoute fit only for the smallest of businesses
* Medium and large businesses that need a more powerful, all-around delivery management solution could choose eLogii instead – a feature-rich, highly customisable platform that grows with your company without breaking the bank

## ElasticRoute reviews – Research methodology

The fact that ElasticRoute has a free-forever plan and a 14-day free trial of its paid-for package enabled us to try it out firsthand, so that’s what we did.

We used ElasticRoute for a whole month to see what it can and cannot do in terms of delivery management.

But we didn’t stop there. We were keen on gaining an even better understanding of ElasticRoute’s capabilities and use cases, so we decided to ask the people who are more than familiar with it – ElasticRoute’s long-term users.

We interviewed at least a dozen of their past and present users, who provided us with invaluable insights into ElasticRoute’s functionality and its most notable advantages and shortcomings.

Moreover, we’ve checked out customer reviews on reputable SaaS rating sites (e.g., G2 and Capterra) to ensure we didn’t overlook any vital details.

And now, let’s get to the juicy bit – we’ll begin by reviewing ElasticRoute’s ease of use.

## ElasticRoute reviews – Ease of use

![ElasticRoute – UI](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-ui.png "ElasticRoute – UI")

The first thing you’ll notice once you look at ElasticRoute’s interface is that it doesn’t have a particularly modern design.

However, this should not discourage you from using ElasticRoute because it makes up for what it lacks in appearance with its overall simplicity.

ElasticRoute’s interface is very intuitive, and since it doesn’t have many advanced features, most users will have no problem wrapping their heads around it in no time.

The platform is robust, so it’s not prone to glitches, lags or breakdowns. Even if you encounter an issue, ElasticRoute’s support is very responsive and quick to come to your aid.

However, they only offer email support, which is not as great as having live chat support 24/7.

ElasticRoute has a pretty thorough help center with lots of detailed step-by-step tutorials to help new users onboard quickly and efficiently.

### The bottom line

ElasticRoute is a simple and robust platform that offers a **satisfactory user experience** for users with varying skill levels. And despite not having an eye-catching interface design, this tool still gets the job done just fine.

It should be noted, though, that ElasticRoute’s simplicity is partly due to its **lack of more advanced and complex features**.

Either way, ElasticRoute works pretty seamlessly as it does not go down or glitch often, so it’s fair to say it’s one of the more reliable [route planning software](https://elogii.com/blog/route-planning-software/) on the market.

## ElasticRoute reviews – Key features

#### 1. Has a free-forever version

Although this isn’t an actual function per se, the fact that ElasticRoute has recently introduced a free-forever plan is definitely one of its biggest advantages.

![ElasticRoute – Free plan](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-free-plan.JPG "ElasticRoute – Free plan")

This package is a perfectly decent option for couriers since it includes just one vehicle and up to 20 stops per day.

Interestingly enough, the free plan provides you with access to all the other ElasticRoute features, such as dashboard API documentation and in-house geocoding.

However, **ElasticRoute does not have a mobile app,** unlike most other route planning software.

This makes it next to impossible for drivers to use it on the road.

As a result, ElasticRoute’s free package is practically useless.

On the one hand, companies with more than one driver will have no use for it. Single drivers and couriers, on the other hand, won’t be able to use it on their phones, and they can’t be expected to be glued to their computers for obvious reasons.

So, although ElasticRoute has a free plan nominally, it **cannot be used for business purposes** in practice.

Individuals who need help with finding optimal routes for their road trips, for example, and other similar purposes, are the only ones who can actually benefit from ElasticRoute’s free plan.

#### 2. Lots of operational parameters

Having plenty of customisable settings is always a good thing when it comes to route planning and delivery management software.

Namely, they are the #1 thing that enables users to optimize a tool for their particular needs, and ElasticRoute sure has many different operational parameters to help you do precisely that.

Some of the things you can set up in ElasticRoute include the following:

* Adding the **“Rush hour” factor** when planning routes. Once you insert the expected increase in the time a vehicle will need to reach its destination due to usual traffic density in a specified time range, ElasticRoute will recalculate the ETAs accordingly

![ElasticRoute – Rush hour](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-rush-hour.png "ElasticRoute – Rush hour")

* **Vehicle capacity** - You can enter load constraints in terms of weight (in kg, pounds, or tons), volume (in liters, gallons, cubic meters, etc.), and seating (the number of items, people, cartons, packages, etc.) to specify how much each vehicle can carry. When adding a stop, just enter the given value in the “Weight Load” field, and the stop will be assigned to the vehicle with the suitable capacity.

![ElasticRoute – Vehicle capacity](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-vehicle-capacity.JPG "ElasticRoute – Vehicle capacity")

* **Vehicle priority** - You can give some vehicles priority over others when assigning stops. This means that the stops will be assigned to the vehicles with the highest priority scores first
* **Time, distance, and stops limits** - Entering the maximum working time, distance, or the number of stops per vehicle per day, gives you more control over your fleet usage. This way, you’ll optimize your efficiency and minimize vehicle wear and tear

![ElasticRoute – Limits](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-limits.JPG "ElasticRoute – Limits")

* **Drivers’ working hours and breaks** - When assigning stops, ElasticRoute will consider each driver’s availability according to these parameters

#### 3. Integrates with Detrack

In itself, ElasticRoute is little more than a route planning software with limited capabilities for route optimization.

![ElasticRoute – Routing](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-routing.png "ElasticRoute – Routing")

Users who are satisfied with ElasticRoute’s features but need a comprehensive delivery management solution could opt for using Detrack + ElasticRoute.

Detrack is a delivery management platform we’ve [reviewed in one of our earlier articles](https://elogii.com/blog/detrack-reviews/). Although it has some pretty handy features, Detrack has no native routing abilities.

This is precisely why it integrates with ElasticRoute.

Since Detrack won’t charge you for the first vehicle you add to it, you could use both Detrack and ElasticRoute for free if you have one vehicle and don’t need more than 20 stops per day.

If you need more stops, you can opt for ElasticRoute’s paid-for plan at $29 a month? and get both ElasticRoute and Detrack for that price.

However, every additional vehicle you add will cost you $39 per month, meaning that the costs will stack up pretty quickly.

Another downside of this feature is that instead of using a single software product with all the functionality you need, you’ll have to use two different platforms and constantly push and pull data between them.

Not very convenient in the least!

#### 4. Thorough API documentation

ElasticRoute has a well-documented API that enables users to integrate this tool well with other systems and platforms for managing the wider supply and delivery chain.

Dashboard API documentation is available free of charge even to users of the free package.

On the other hand, Routing Engine API is charged separately, as seen below.

![ElasticRoute – Routing API price](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-routing-api-price.png "ElasticRoute – Routing API price")

#### The bottom line

ElasticRoute has a solid set of functionalities for a route planning platform – provided basic route planning is everything you need.

As we mentioned before, ElasticRoute cannot be used for overall delivery management. If you want that, you’ll have to use both Detrack and ElasticRoute, which is not exactly an optimal solution.

Either way, if you’re seriously considering ElasticRoute, you should keep in mind the following:

* ElasticRoute’s geocoding isn’t spot-on precise
* There are **no dynamic routing options whatsoever.** This means that ElasticRoute cannot adjust to events that happen on the road, nor can it consider factors like traffic density, weather conditions, etc., when planning routes
* There is **no auto-dispatching** available. ElasticRoute cannot automatically assign orders based on sophisticated parameters such as driver’s skills
* ElasticRoute **doesn't have a mobile app** for drivers. Consequently, your drivers won’t get access to on-the-road navigation, nor will they be able to do things like collect PODs, contact customers or dial your dispatchers

## ElasticRoute reviews – Pricing policy

![ElasticRoute – Pricing](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-pricing.JPG "ElasticRoute – Pricing")

On paper, ElasticRoute has a free forever plan. However, since it’s free for just one vehicle and gets you only 20 stops max per route, this package is not enough for most businesses.

**Companies will have to opt for its paid-for plan** to get the most out of ElasticRoute’s functionality.

When billed monthly, ElasticRoute will cost you $29 per vehicle per month. Annual billing however, comes witha discount.

Should you decide to combine it with Detrack, you can expect to pay $39 per vehicle per month.

![ElasticRoute + Detrack – Pricing](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-detrack-pricing.png "ElasticRoute + Detrack – Pricing")

There’s also a 14-day free trial of its paid-for plan.

### The bottom line

At first, ElasticRoute seems like an affordable option, especially if you consider its free package.

However, the fact that it charges users on a per-vehicle basis means that the costs of using it will skyrocket as your fleet grows.

## ElasticRoute reviews – Best use cases

As attractive as ElasticRoute’s free version may seem at first, we have to warn you: **Its free plan is only viable for non-businesses** because it simply cannot accommodate the needs of even the smallest commercial ventures.

Moreover, its per-vehicle pricing makes ElasticRoute a less-than-optimal solution for medium and large businesses as well, and an especially poor option for those with more than a dozen vehicles in their fleet.

So, it’s fair to say that **ElasticRoute can be a match for the smallest businesses** that only need route planning.

Users who require a more advanced platform that can cover their delivery management from top to bottom will simply find that ElasticRoute leaves much to be desired. Of course, there’s always the option to use ElasticRoute and Detrack combined.

However, if you’re not too keen on dealing with two separate tools to get what other providers include in a single platform, you should consider an alternative solution.

## ElasticRoute reviews – Best alternative for comprehensive delivery management

Businesses requiring an actual delivery management and optimization platform will find that [eLogii](https://elogii.com/?utm_content=CjwKCAjwi8iXBhBeEiwAKbUofdQnjQahWiV5t2e0M0s0YABbge-xfy-c7ljN2m9iQ68lAqx9x_4BghoC7WYQAvD_BwE), with its numerous and versatile functionality, could be the perfect solution.

eLogii has a **wide range of highly-customisable features** which makes it a perfect fit for a variety of businesses - from field service providers to retailers, pharmaceutical companies, restaurants, couriers, [food & drink delivery](https://elogii.com/blog/food-delivery-route-optimization/) services, etc.

Some of its features include:

* Cutting-edge routing functionality, - including **dynamic**, **multi-day**, and **multi-depot routing**. eLogii’s latest generation routing AI enables it to easily replan and adjust routes on the go, with consideration for various factors like traffic, weather conditions, roadblocks, etc.

![eLogii dynamic routing](/blog/uploads/elogii-dynamic-routing.png "eLogii dynamic routing")Various methods of ensuring customer satisfaction - These include sending **real-time SMS and/or email notifications** from every stage of the delivery process, **real-time ETA notifications** (with updated recalculations if something changes on the road), **live tracking of each order,** etc.

![eLogii customer notifications](/blog/uploads/elogii-customer-notifications.JPG "eLogii customer notifications")

* Numerous **customisable operational parameters** which enable things like assigning more challenging routes to the most skilled agents or automating vehicle load optimization that ensures that each vehicle is used to its fullest capacity, etc.

![eLogii drivers_ profiles](/blog/uploads/elogii-drivers_-profiles.JPG "eLogii drivers_ profiles")

* **A vast number of POD collection methods** (including **barcode** and **QR scanning**, among others) auto timestamps and geotags
* **Failed delivery workflows** to instruct drivers what to do if they cannot find the end customer at the delivery location (e.g., you can allow leaving it with a neighbor or returning it to the depot, etc.)

![eLogii failed delivery workflow](/blog/uploads/elogii-failed-delivery-workflow.JPG "eLogii failed delivery workflow")

* A seamless **driver app optimized for all operating systems** - Some of its capabilities include live chat with dispatchers and customers, one-click dials, navigation, POD collection, task overview and management, etc.

![eLogii driver app](/blog/uploads/elogii-driver-app.JPG "eLogii driver app")

* A [**well-documented API**](https://api-docs.elogii.com/) integrates seamlessly with all the other tools and technologies you use to manage your supply chain operations

When it comes to its pricing, eLogii doesn’t publish off-the-peg prices.

Instead, eLogii has [**custom-tailored pricing plans**](https://elogii.com/pricing?utm_content=CjwKCAjwi8iXBhBeEiwAKbUofdQnjQahWiV5t2e0M0s0YABbge-xfy-c7ljN2m9iQ68lAqx9x_4BghoC7WYQAvD_BwE) based on your business’s particular configuration and needs, with typical entry-level prices starting at around $359 per month for 2500 tasks.

Each plan includes **unlimited users, drivers, and vehicles** – an excellent option for larger businesses or those aiming to scale.

![elogii pricing](/blog/uploads/elogii-pricing.png "elogii pricing")

The fact that eLogii doesn’t have one-size-fits-all pricing packages is one of the things that make it an **ideal solution for small, medium, and large businesses alike**.

You can [compare each plan’s features](https://elogii.com/plans-and-features?utm_content=Cj0KCQjwidSWBhDdARIsAIoTVb3rzMUA0BtUIPyXleIaPk7ODhqHDEWXrpWW_HCGKoi2omXmaU7DErUaAuT1EALw_wcB) on its webpage for a detailed overview of what each eLogii package includes.

## ElasticRoute reviews – Final takeaways

If you’re an individual looking for a free, easy-to-use, and robust solution for basic route planning, ElasticRoute can be a great choice indeed.

On the other hand, businesses will have to opt for ElasticcRoute’s paid-for plan straight off the bat. And since this platform has a per-vehicle pricing policy, it will be no good for any but the smallest of businesses.

Companies with larger fleets will quickly discover that ElasticRoute is far too expensive an option, especially once you consider that it cannot do much more than basic route planning.

And that can mean only one thing:

Businesses of all types and sizes that are looking for a more sophisticated, feature-rich, and easily scalable solution for all-around delivery management should go for eLogii instead.
