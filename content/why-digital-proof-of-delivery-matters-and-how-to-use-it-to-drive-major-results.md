It used to be that customers would physically sign documents to indicate that they received their goods, but times have changed.

Now, digital Proof of Delivery (POD or ePOD) is the new process involved in validating the receipt of goods by customers.

Many companies have shifted to electronic proof of delivery methods instead because they’re far more convenient and streamlined. With the hassle of paperwork removed, deliveries can be taken care of easily and quickly.

Digital proof of delivery software can create reliable records of services or goods delivered while also documenting customer claims. This will make customers, as well as businesses, feel more secure about deliveries.

Learn everything you need to know about proof of deliveries and cybersecurity in this article.

And here’s a quick summary:

## TL;DR

* There are several cybersecurity risks involved with using digital proof of delivery software, but by taking precautionary steps, your business can be secure at all times.

## Types of digital proof of delivery

There are several digital proof of delivery methods that companies can choose to use, and all of them can simplify the delivery process and reduce the need for physical delivery documents.

Here are the most popular methods:

* Electronic signatures

This is one of the most common ways to secure electronic proof of delivery, and it’s been used for many years.

It’s pretty simple: the customer will sign their name electronically upon receiving their order, and their signature is uploaded to the software’s data warehouse.

* Photos

Commonly used by delivery services, photos can serve as one of the easiest forms of digital proof of delivery. Once the photo has been taken with your delivery app, it will be sent to the customer as well as the delivery company’s system automatically.

However, since the customer isn’t always present when photos are taken, photos can be risky and disputed if the package gets stolen. The internet is full of videos, for example, that show delivery drivers taking a photo of a delivered package before someone steals it.

So, because there is no clear documentation that proves the customer received the package, photos are best used as a secondary form of proof rather than the main method.

* Scanned barcodes and QR codes

This form of digital proof of delivery is quite popular because it makes your delivery operations quick and uncomplicated. Your delivery drivers simply scan barcodes or QR codes during their delivery, and the relevant information is sent to the system.

* Alphanumeric codes

Similar to barcodes and QR codes, every delivery can be tracked through alphanumeric codes.

Here’s how this works: every delivery or package will receive a unique code of numbers and letters. This code allows you to monitor the delivery process – including when a package was delivered.

## Digital proof of deliveries and cybersecurity – What are the risks?

Being ignorant can be extremely costly, so there are several risks to be aware of when using electronic proof of delivery.

Here are a few of the biggest risks:

* Data breaches

Roughly [15 million data records](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307426/number-of-data-breaches-worldwide/#:\~:text=Global%20number%20of%20breached%20data%20sets%202020-2022&text=During%20the%20third%20quarter%20of,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20quarter.) were exposed through data breaches in the third quarter of 2022 alone – 37% more than the previous quarter.

This means that globally, cybersecurity has become a big concern.

[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307426/number-of-data-breaches-worldwide/#:\~:text=Global%20number%20of%20breached%20data%20sets%202020-2022&text=During%20the%20third%20quarter%20of,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20quarter.) - Data records exposed from 2020 to 2022

Deliveries may seem safe against this kind of breach, but you’re dealing with people’s private information, such as their addresses, names, businesses, and shipping details.

Data breaches can happen to any business at any point, so it’s important to take precautions and work with reliable software. Using secure software such as eLogii, for example, will help you protect your customer’s data against compromise or theft.

* Incorrect data storage and human error

Human error should never be underestimated – it’s the number one cybersecurity risk for many companies.

Incorrectly inputting data can lead to problems down the road when deliveries aren’t made or are carried out with incorrect information. Thankfully, this kind of problem can be avoided for the most part by giving employees proper training and making sure they don’t work when sick or tired.

* Signature data is stolen by bad actors

Many customers may insist on signing for their deliveries because that’s how things have been done for ages. However, this comes with the risk of outsiders breaking into your company’s data and stealing these signatures.

Putting security measures in place and only using reliable software will minimize the risk of your customers’ signature data ending up in the wrong hands. You can also use other forms of proof of delivery.

* Malware compromises your ePOD system

Malware can creep into any system, even one that’s secure and protected.

It’s recommended that any company that operates digitally perform regular malware and virus scans to make sure nothing nefarious makes its way into their systems.

You should also conduct training with your staff to teach them how to identify phishing emails and suspicious download links (a common way malware makes its way into company systems).

* Legitimate privilege abuse

Although this isn’t a common security problem for you to worry about, it’s still something to be aware of. Legitimate privilege abuse occurs when someone within your company accesses information they shouldn’t – like customer information or information from another department.

It’s important that companies only allow a limited number of people access to private customer information to avoid any kind of abuse of data. You should also use software with good data storage practices (like eLogii).

* A lack of backups leads to data loss

The digital storage of data is becoming the norm, but that doesn’t mean it’s invulnerable to the kind of problems that physical storage faces. If there is no backup of data, it can be lost forever when something goes wrong.

There are many ways that digital data can be lost, including power failures, viruses, software corruption, natural disasters, and even human error.

To avoid this kind of data loss, always make sure your data is backed up at least once, preferably more than once.
