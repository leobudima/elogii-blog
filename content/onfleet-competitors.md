Whether your main concern is route optimisation, delivery planning, or operational efficiency, growing numbers of businesses like yours are looking for alternatives to Onfleet.

Maybe it’s too expensive for what you get.

Maybe you need to be able to define more delivery, driver, and vehicle parameters than Onfleet can handle.

Or maybe it’s something else.

To help you find the right software for your business, we’re taking an in-depth look at Onfleet and three of the best alternatives on the market.

Or, if you’re short of time…

## TL;DR

* Onfleet’s features are best suited to smaller businesses with straightforward requirements - but it’s expensive if you more than just the bare basics
* eLogii offers automatic route planning with the widest array of choices for customisation available on the market, for businesses from SMB to large enterprise
* Bringg is ideal for larger companies that want to manage deliveries and inventory through an integrated platform
* Tookan has its own app ecosystem and starts at a very low price - but making it suit your needs can end up complex and pricey

## Why you should consider alternatives to Onfleet

Expectations around deliveries have skyrocketed since the start of the pandemic.

The old model, where companies take (for example) two to five working days for delivery just doesn’t cut it anymore. Next-day or even same-day is what shoppers and businesses now demand. That, along with clear, up-to-the-minute information about when their packages are going to arrive.

### For businesses, this puts huge demands on their logistics arrangements. And with [last-mile delivery accounting for 41% of total supply chain costs in 2020](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-statistics-2020/), the need to optimise the system has never been greater.

Onfleet does a great job in this space and it handles millions of deliveries in more than 90 countries. But is it right for your business? We’re going to take you through the pros and cons of some of the best alternatives, and why they might suit your needs better.

### Who is Onfleet for?

Onfleet was one of the pioneers of the SaaS model in delivery management software that charges a flat rate subscription fee up to a fixed number of monthly “tasks” (ie pickups and deliveries). Go over that limit and you’ll be charged anywhere between 13 and 18 cents per task, depending on which product tier you’re on.

It’s a great last-mile solution for small to medium companies that need to handle moderate delivery volumes - although if you’re too small, the flat rate works against you.

Onfleet has a clean, attractive user interface for both admins and drivers, and it’s simple enough for non-specialists to get up to speed quickly while offering lots of powerful functionality.

In terms of what users think, Onfleet gets a score of 4.5 out of 5 on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/onfleet/reviews), and 4.7 on both [Capterra](https://www.capterra.co.uk/software/142633/onfleet) and [GetApp](https://www.getapp.co.uk/reviews/106593/onfleet).

### What does Onfleet offer?

All of Onfleet’s packages provide:

* Unlimited users and team management
* Driver tracking and analytics, displayed in real-time
* Triggered customer notifications and anonymous driver/customer communications
* Proof of delivery capture via photo and signature

![Onfleet competitors - Onfleet’s UI](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-onfleet-s-ui.jpg "Onfleet competitors - Onfleet’s UI")

But the Starter package - with its attractive $149 per month flat rate charge (when billed annually - it’s $199 when you pay monthly) - is missing a lot of what all but the smallest companies are going to expect as standard. For example:

* Automated route optimisation - routes have to be uploaded manually
* Predictive delivery ETAs
* Driver/dispatcher chat
* API access, enabling integrations with other platforms

The Basic package (starting at $349 per month) includes these, but it only provides 2,500 tasks per month and it lacks barcode scanning and age verification. You’ll need to upgrade again to get those.

However, it is very easy to get started with and provides some great analytics views that can help you identify areas for savings and service improvements.

### What does Onfleet cost?

![Onfleet competitors - Onfleet’s pricing](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-onfleet-s-pricing.jpg)

At $799 per month for the Premium package - the minimum level that provides most of what a logistics manager will be looking for in a planning, routing, and dispatch software solution - is not cheap.

And with a minimum of one year’s commitment at that level, you don’t have flexibility if Onfleet doesn’t do what you need.

While the Basic package provides a free trial and 90-day contract terms, with only 2,500 actions per month it may not be feasible to use as a test run for medium-sized and larger businesses exploring their options.

## Onfleet Alternative #1: eLogii

OK, so you may have noticed that this is the eLogii blog…

Naturally, we think we have the best alternative to Onfleet but we don’t expect you to just take our word for it! We’ll aim to show - as objectively as possible - how for many use cases, eLogii meets businesses' needs better than any of these competitors.

### Who is eLogii for?

eLogii is a cloud-based, end-to-end delivery management software solution, enabling you to digitize your last-mile operations, and better plan, route, and optimise your delivery and/or field operations.

![Onfleet competitors - eLogii](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-elogii.png "Onfleet competitors - eLogii")

It’s built for businesses of any size, in any vertical, that want to get the most out of their fleets at the lowest cost. Unlike Onfleet and, say, Tookan which are designed for small businesses and struggle to meet the needs of large enterprises.

Where eLogii stands out is:

* The huge range of parameters and configurations it allows
* A user interface that makes even the most advanced features simple to learn how to benefit from
* The far larger range of native integrations it offers than the alternatives, along with API and webhook access for all users - providing an unprecedented level of flexibility to customise your IT stack

Tools that are aimed at a wide market usually achieve this by having a one-size-fits-all approach, but not eLogii. With deep configurability, it’s ideal for verticals as diverse as medical and pharmaceutical, food and drink, 3PL, and couriers.

It also makes it possible to provide a standard of customer experience that the competition will find hard to match.

### Why choose eLogii over Onfleet?

We’ll get onto pricing shortly, but hold that thought while we look at functionality…

![Onfleet competitors - eLogii’s superior customisation](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-elogii-s-superior-customisation.png "Onfleet competitors - eLogii’s superior customisation")

Above all, eLogii includes automatic route planning for all users - enabling you to identify the best routes with just two clicks and in an average of 15 seconds. With Onfleet, you simply don’t get that in the Starter package.

Plus, eLogii lets you manage the widest range of parameters, constraints, and special requirements in optimising routes, timings, and costs of any tool available. For example:

* Specify driver skills to ensure that the best drivers are allocated certain jobs (eg heavy deliveries, certain locations, etc)
* Specify vehicle types, load optimisation preferences (eg volume, weight, pallet number, etc)
* Define point of delivery actions and associated timings, and workflows for when things don’t go according to plan
* Set tolerances for early/late deliveries and responses to traffic conditions
* Require any type of Proof of Delivery (barcode scan, signature, photograph) and even driver actions on delivery

This lets your team get really specific about customer experience, making ETAs more accurate and allowing for a far greater range of unexpected factors. It also gives you total visibility over your drivers and their timings.

Thirdly, eLogii enables you to update and re-optimise routes live while drivers are in transit. If a customer has to dash out at their designated slot, it’s a simple drag-and-drop operation to reorder the driver’s task list - and the technology will recalculate the optimal routes and new delivery times.

![Onfleet competitors - eLogii’s automated route optimisation](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-elogii-s-automated-route-optimisation.jpg "Onfleet competitors - eLogii’s automated route optimisation")

You might think a tool with so many options would be complicated to use. That’s not the case with eLogii. The user interface is extremely straightforward, and the learning curve has been designed by UX experts to be very easy to grasp.

Indeed, eLogii was built with day-to-day users in mind, rather than people with explicit training in logistics or delivery management - and yet its exceptional design means that it can be configured to optimise performance for virtually any business.

But like we said, don’t just take our word for it. Listen to the users: eLogii has a 4.9 out of 5 rating on [Capterra](https://www.capterra.co.uk/software/202055/elogii) and [GetApp](https://www.getapp.co.uk/software/132311/elogii).

### What does eLogii cost?

As you might expect for something so flexible, eLogii has a lot of different pricing options that reflect individual users’ needs.

But with our entry price from just $359 per month for unlimited users and drivers - including all of the features discussed above (many of which Onfleet holds back from lower-tier customers, if it even has them) - eLogii is highly competitive.

[Book a demo now](https://elogii.com/book-demo) and one of our product specialists will show you eLogii in action and, with answers to a few questions, be able to give you a price. Then, you’ll get a pilot period with eLogii configured to your requirements - letting you get straight in to experience the value without the hassle of setting it up yourself.

## Onfleet Alternative #2:Bringg

Bringg is an Israel-headquartered tech business that provides a cloud platform that connects, automates, and orchestrates supply chains and people - primarily in the last-mile context.

### Who is Bringg for?

Bringg is primarily aimed at large enterprises in retail, food and grocery, and healthcare. Their customers include Wal-Mart, the Co-Op, Coca-Cola, and KFC.

While Bringg does have smaller customers, its services are tailored most to big businesses, where deliveries and supply chains are integrated and which can make use of both their delivery and backend management capabilities.

### Why choose Bringg over Onfleet?

Bringg offers similar features to Onfleet - including driver management, route optimisation, real-time visibility, a mobile app, analytics, POD collection, etc - but integrates all this into a wider logistics and inventory management system.

![Onfleet competitors - Bringg’s UI](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-bringg-s-ui-2.jpg "Onfleet competitors - Bringg’s UI")

For example, it allows all packages to be allocated a bar code (a POD-only paid-for extra with Onfleet) that enables inventory management and tracking back in the warehouse, as well as on-route.

With an open API, Bringg can easily be integrated into eCommerce and other platforms to automate your entire business.

Of course, to get these benefits requires a relatively long lead-time. And this is not a system that’s easy to just pick up and implement. It’s complex, reflecting its end-to-end design.

And as you can see, Bringg has a tired-looking user interface that could use a refresh!

A fair number of reviewers have noted the Bringg app’s tendency to crash when overwhelmed. It scores 3.5 on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/bringg/reviews), and 4.9 on [Capterra](https://www.capterra.co.uk/software/145854/bringg) and [GetApp](https://www.getapp.co.uk/software/131751/bringg).

And there are a few strange omissions. There’s no Geofencing (offered as standard by eLogii and Tookan, for example), for example. And options for customising the UI are very limited.

However, if you’re a bigger business running an integrated supply chain and delivery operation, Bringg can do a lot more to optimise your activities than Onfleet can by itself.

### What does Bringg cost?

Good question.

Bringg’s pricing is not made publicly available. It would seem to be tiered based on delivery numbers, as that’s a question you have to answer when booking a sales meeting.

Nor is there a free trial available.

![Onfleet competitors - Bringg’s pricing](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-bringg-s-pricing.jpg "Onfleet competitors - Bringg’s pricing")

So, when it comes to Bringg’s price competitiveness, you’ll have to figure that out for yourselves!

## Onfleet Alternative #3:Tookan

### Jungleworks’ Tookan is a delivery management platform with a bit of a difference. It’s part of a wider suite of products and add-ons that allows users to tailor truly unique solutions.

### Who is Tookan for?

Tookan is best-suited for smaller businesses handling local deliveries with an in-house driver team (eg taxi companies, restaurants, etc). It has a very low entry price, a 14-day free trial, and it’s renowned for being easy to use.

![Onfleet competitors - Tookan’s UI](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-tookan-s-ui.jpg "Onfleet competitors - Tookan’s UI")

Plus, native integrations with Jungleworks’ other software tools mean that Tookan can be fitted into a wide variety of “off the peg” custom IT ecosystems.

### Why choose Tookan over Onfleet?

Tookan has a lot of great features:

* Easy to get started and helpful, straightforward onboarding
* Driver management, analytics, live chat, open APIs on all packages, real-time tracking, POD confirmation by barcode, photo, signature, etc
* Customer SMS and email alerts
* A 14-day free trial

Where it stands out is through the ecosystem of add-ons that Jungleworks has created. If the marketplace doesn’t have what you need, you can build an extension yourself or connect to third-party tools via Zapier.

![Onfleet competitors - Tookan add-ons](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-tookan-add-ons.jpg "Onfleet competitors - Tookan add-ons")

It even provides custom order forms that plug straight into the dispatch system, rather than requiring you to integrate your own, which is brilliant for micro-businesses.

Tookan also provides some of the most comprehensive training materials for users out there, right down to the level of how to build integrations.

However, compared to the other apps we looked at, Tookan’s review profile is somewhat less positive: it scores 4.2 out of 5 on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/tookan/reviews), and 4.4 on [Capterra](https://www.capterra.co.uk/software/218952/tookan) and [GetApp](https://www.getapp.co.uk/software/122279/tookan). Quite a few reviews mention software glitches and customer service issues - but just as many say the opposite!

### What does Tookan cost?

![Onfleet competitors - Tookan pricing](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-tookan-pricing.jpg "Onfleet competitors - Tookan pricing")

When you look at those entry-level prices, you can see why Tookan is extremely attractive to micro-businesses. Pricing is also task-based, and you might be forgiven for thinking that - with a 5,000 task limit - Tookan’s Standard package beats the competition.

But wait! Tookan’s modular structure means that you have to pay extra for a lot of features that come as standard in the alternatives. Route optimisation costs 12 cents extra per task, for example. optimising the routes for 5,000 tasks would add $600 a month to the $359 price. ETAs on your dashboard cost $49 a month, and so on.

![Onfleet competitors - Tookan add-ons pricing](/blog/uploads/onfleet-competitors-tookan-add-ons-pricing.jpg "Onfleet competitors - Tookan add-ons pricing")

Tookan can quickly end up being a very expensive option.

## Conclusion

So there you have it: the pros and cons of Onfleet, and its three leading competitors - eLogii, Bringg, and Tookan.

* If you’re running a micro-business that only delivers within a small area, Tookan is extremely cheap - but when your needs expand, it becomes expensive fast
* Bringg is designed for enterprises, which offers delivery management and route optimisation as just one part of a comprehensive supply chain management solution. It is likely to be overly monolithic for a lot of companies that want the freedom to integrate multiple platforms into a bespoke solution
* eLogii has all the power of Bringg combined with the simplicity and user-friendliness of Onfleet, plus much more. Its customisability and extensive range of integrations means eLogii can generate real efficiencies in your business fast and help you build and deliver any customer experience you want
