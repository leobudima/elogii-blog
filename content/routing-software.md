Today, we’re going to show you what routing software ACTUALLY gives you…

When you invest $2000 per month.

This may seem like a lot right now.

And it is.

(We’re not kidding ourselves, it’s a HUGE investment).

But you also get a HUGE bang for your buck.

With amazing returns…

And even better growth opportunities.

So if you’re ready to go “all in” with routing software, this article is for you.

Let’s dive right in.

## Why Does Routing Software Cost So Much?

Let’s face it:

$2000 per month is no small chunk of change.

It’s an annual investment of $24,000.

And that’s a lot of money out of your pocket.

But here’s the deal:

You DON’T have to invest so much.

There are free routing solutions out there.

Like Google Maps.

And you can definitely use it to plan routes.

But does it work for your delivery? Your supply chain? Your distribution? For your business?

NO! It sucks!

That’s why we did a whole article about [route planning with Google Maps](https://elogii.com/blog/route-planning-google-maps/):

But free route planning software isn’t your only option.

You can also choose a smaller plan.

And most route planning tools have these pricing plans on offer.

Including [eLogii](https://elogii.com/plans-and-features?utm_content=CjwKCAjw4ayUBhA4EiwATWyBrsZhyiT3NSbyFeXBHOR4w6dBZbtdUUsMvdRUnuEvyRrYYh_9IpaEiRoC4hEQAvD_BwE):

![routing software pricing and plans](/blog/uploads/routing-software-pricing-and-plans.png "routing software pricing and plans")

(Which starts at $359 per month for 2500 tasks.)

And this entry-level plan has great value for money.

But it can’t compete with the feature-rich environment of the AAA professional level.

It’s the same case with all of [the best route planning software in 2022](https://elogii.com/blog/route-planning-software/):

The higher tier the plan you choose, the more you’ll pay.

But it also means:

The greater access to features…

The more you can do…

And the better the returns on your investment.

So…

## What Do You Get When You Invest $2000 Per Month In Routing Software?

There’s a lot of route optimization software out there.

Almost all of them offer professional or enterprise or custom plans.

Plans like these give you access to all of the software features.

Which means you get to use the tool to the full extent of its capabilities.

But:

Just like their pricing plans, features differ from software to software.

You’ll get one set of features with [Optimoroute](https://elogii.com/blog/optimoroute-reviews/) or [Bringg](https://elogii.com/blog/bringg-competitors/)…

And you’ll get some additional features with [Onfleet](https://elogii.com/blog/onfleet-competitors/), or [Circuit](https://elogii.com/blog/circuit-review/).

Or you may be missing some of them with [Tookan](https://elogii.com/blog/tookan-reviews/) or [Fleet Complete](https://elogii.com/blog/fleet-complete-competitors/).

**eLogii** has the most comprehensive feature list on the market.

In fact, we offer **98 distinctive features** with our top-tier professional plan.

We’ll use our features list to give you an idea of the routing software capabilities.

And what you actually get for your subscription:

## What Else Do You Get When for $2000 Per Month for Routing Software?

Routing software providers and packages are different in two other ways:

* **No. of tasks (stops)** that you can plan per month
* **No. of drivers or vehicles** that you can plan routes for
* **No. of users** that can have access to the software

With a top-tier plan with most providers you’ll typically get:

* 30,000-40,000 tasks or stops (pick-up and drop-off)
* Unlimited number of drivers and vehicles
* 10-unlimited number of user profiles

By comparison, with a starter plan, you’ll get:

* 1,500-2,500 tasks or stops (pick-up and drop-off)
* Up to 10 drivers and/or vehicles
* 1-3 user profiles

Typically, top tier plans and packages are also customizable.

So, with providers like eLogii, Bringg, Optimoroute, and several others there is virtually no limit to tasks, stops, drivers, vehicles, routes, or users.

The only difference is how you’ll get priced.

For example, with eLogii it’s a fixed fee per month paid annually.

With [Routific](https://elogii.com/blog/routific-competitors/), on the other hand, it’s a fixed price per vehicle per month.

But, on average, the monthly fee you can expect to pay is $2000.

## How Does Routing Software Generate Higher Efficiency, More Profits, Lower Costs, and ROI?

Listing all our 98 routing software features is all fine and well.

But how does the software actually help you?

And how do you generate returns on that investment in real life?

In this part of the article, we explore exactly that.

You’ll see the different ways it boosts [delivery KPIs](https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/) across all areas of operation.

And how our clients use routing software to that effect:

### Helps build an agile delivery

Automating operations helps you to [build an agile delivery](https://elogii.com/blog/agile-delivery-operations/).

Using technology initiates the agile transformation.

Which touches all aspects of your business: people, processes, and structure.

In turn:

You improve the speed of delivery, decision-making, and other activities that make your operations more dynamic.

### Smart multi-depot planning

Not choosing the right depot sites across raises time to pick-up.

In fact, drive time to pick-up accounts for [18% of the total distance traveled on average](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1687814017717663).

So it’s vital to optimize those locations to reflect your last-mile operations.

![multi depot planning with routing software](/blog/uploads/multi-depot-planning-with-routing-software.png "multi depot planning with routing software")

And with routing software you can use it to select the best pick-up sites.

To optimize pick-up time and duration for each route.

Which cuts the drive time and fuel it takes to reach them.

### Streamline the supply chain

Routing software is an end-to-end solution.

So you can use it to manage and optimize your last mile of delivery.

But your first mile, as well.

This is all thanks to API integration.

![routing software api](/blog/uploads/routing-software-api.png "routing software api")

Which enables you to connect the routing software to any other app or system you use.

That includes order and inventory management systems.

In doing so, you get complete control of your supply chain.

Which includes managing when, how often, and how many products you order from suppliers.

But you also optimize the routes drivers take and locations from where your supplies arrive.

### Expand the delivery offer

Raising operational efficiency allows you to expand the delivery offer.

Simply because you raise your [delivery speed](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-speed/).

This opens up space for you to offer faster delivery options to customers.

For example, next-day, or even, [same-day delivery](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-offer-same-day-delivery-using-delivery-management-software/).

But it also enables you to offer other on-demand fulfillment options:

* Free delivery
* Curbside delivery
* Fixed delivery
* Click & collect

### Raise stop density

Routing software automatically prioritizes stop density.

**Planning routes with the highest stop density** involves ordering the maximum number of stops with the closest proximity to reduce drive time between them.

Here’s what that looks like:

![stop density with routing software](/blog/uploads/stop-density-with-routing-software.jpg "stop density with routing software")

With less time spent in a vehicle, drivers reach more stops.

And when your drivers can handle more orders, [transportation costs](https://elogii.com/blog/transportation-costs/) go down.

  
Which means you can offer cheaper services.

And be more competitive.

### Reduce cost per delivery

Route planning software is a modular system, as well.

The various modules work coherently to optimize the entire delivery process.

So even the smallest improvement reduces cost per delivery.

And we’ve already mentioned 98 ways you can automate operations.

### Lowers time per delivery

The software enables a variety of parameters when planning routes.

These include:

* Types of roads
* Traffic patterns
* Number of road crossings
* Roundabouts and traffic junctions
* Stoplights en route
* Crossing the line of traffic (turns)

All of this means drivers will use routes that actually lower the time it takes to reach each stop.

### Raises delivery accuracy

Routing software relies on geolocation and GPS.

This helps you to map out routes with the utmost precision.

All drivers are also equipped with their own driver app.

Which can integrate with Waze and Google Maps.

![routing-software-google-maps-waze-integration](/blog/uploads/routing-software-google-maps-waze-integration.png "routing-software-google-maps-waze-integration")

So they can use it on the road for turn-by-turn navigation.

You can also add notes to each task.

Which lets you give more detailed instructions to your drivers.

For example, you can let them know the floor where the customer is located.

Or add a specific access point to the building that they should use.

### Cut service time at drop-off

You can add service times with routing software.

This tells drivers how much time they can spend at each stop.

Or how much time they have to service each customer.

This helps you to plan a more detailed timetable for them.

And in turn, [plan better delivery schedules](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-plan-better-delivery-schedules/).

### Find and reduce waste

Technically, delivery is a wasteful process.

And although it’s an essential service in 2022, it doesn’t generate direct revenue.

This means cutting costs is the only way to make it profitable.

That’s why routing software has data and analytics capabilities.

Those features help you to keep track of important KPIs over time.

Which makes it easier to find and eliminate operational inefficiencies.

And this includes a number of things:

From how many orders you fulfill per route…

Through how much fuel vehicles consume during drop-off…

To the size of the fleet…

Or how much capacity of each vehicle is used per route.

And then all you have to do is implement changes to make them more efficient.

(Which you can do continuously time and time again.)

### Handle more with less

[Planning better routes](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-plan-better-delivery-routes/) = Less time it takes to reach customers.

Less time it takes drivers to fulfill orders = More orders fulfilled.

As a result:

You can [raise order volumes](https://elogii.com/blog/average-order-value/%5C) without increasing the size of your fleet.

And you can handle more with less by simply making your operations more efficient.

### Expand the delivery network

As you raise efficiency, you’ll reduce workload.

This leaves more hours for all of your employees to focus on other activities.

Be it your drivers fulfilling more orders.

Giving new responsibilities to dispatchers.

Or delivery managers exploring new markets.

(And creating strategies to grow your delivery network.)

Whatever it is, you and your team will have more time to do it.

Thanks to routing software.

## What Is Your ROI with eLogii When You Invest $2000 per Month?

eLogii’s routing software generates quick ROI.

How quick?

One client had a **105% increase in operational cost savings** IN THE FIRST MONTH.

To be exact:

The company saved **$7,931.70** for their fleet of seven delivery vans.

A year into their subscription, the company recorded a [265% ROI with our route planning software](https://elogii.com/blog/route-planning-software-roi/):

![routing-software-use-case-roi](/blog/uploads/routing-software-use-case-roi.png "routing-software-use-case-roi")

They were able to achieve such a high ROI, because eLogii helped optimize four key areas:

1\. Fuel consumption

2\. Office personnel activities

3\. Customer communications

4\. Driver performance

But:

[Delivery optimization](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-optimization/) also helped them to **increase online sales by 56%**.

So the actual returns with our solutions were extremely high.

Which allowed the company to grow and scale their operations.

While remaining on the same payment plan.

And there’s still a lot more both you and they can do to raise efficiency.

But we get it.

You’re still not convinced.

So why not then…
