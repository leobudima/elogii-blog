Wondering if Shipsy is the right fit? Our detailed Shipsy reviews have all the answers you need

If you’re looking for an end-to-end logistics and supply chain management solution, Shipsy might be just the kind of platform you’re looking for.

To make the best decision, however, you need to know all about Shipsy - important stuff like:

* Overall user experience
* Core functionality
* Pricing
* Use cases

Lucky for you, we researched and analysed all of this in-depth so you wouldn’t have to.

And if you find that Shipsy doesn’t do the trick for you, don’t worry – we’ll also offer an alternative solution.

## TLDR

* Shipsy is primarily an end-to-end logistics management solution best suited for enterprises and businesses dealing with international freight operations
* Shipsy’s strongest points are its options for simplifying freight forwarding and procuring, its capability to manage the entire supply chain (thanks to its versatile functions), and the ability to find and coordinate 3PL service providers
* Its functionality probably comes with a price to match, and judging from Shipsy user reviews, it’s fair to guess that this platform is on the pricier end of the range
* Shipsy’s set of features makes it a good fit for the biggest of big businesses that deal with complex logistics
* Mid-sized and smaller businesses, as well as any company (regardless of size and type) that are primarily focused on last-mile delivery, would do better to choose eLogii – a flexible, feature-rich solution that’s easy to scale and customise

## Shipsy reviews – Research methodology

Our goal is to provide you with first-rate information, and we’ve done a couple of things to make that possible:

1. We’ve interviewed a number of past and present users to find out what they liked and disliked the most about Shipsy, why they opted for it in the first place, and why they stopped using it
2. We’ve also combed through customer reviews on reputable SaaS rating websites such as Capterra, GetApp, and G2 to get a clear picture of Shipsy’s pros, cons, and best use cases

We’ll begin by reviewing Shipsy’s overall user experience, i.e., its ease of use and interface design.

## Shipsy reviews – Ease of use

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0snr6UgxqOAj9xNmGL0I3AuuB6-WajkFd_WZtVddKRWe9lCVzw-Ct4nsrRlfPfqWTRGiuHGfcIEwa6-ylDQqG3Nx2O1KoY27Sis2VEDn2lrPiycj5Pft9TbBNwAi3RGdm7_2EukAak9LhNY205GsLToUhBV2JklS4x3WYvhiFwvgUh4xJyKwlIxUZw =624x328)

Shipsy – UI

It seems that Shipsy users have mixed feelings about this platform’s ease of use.

Some users claim it’s very intuitive, while others complain that it’s challenging to understand and navigate.

The truth is somewhere in between.

Namely, some Shipsy functions really are a breeze to use, like its tracking options or the drivers’ app.

However, some more advanced features, particularly those regarding shipment procuring and forwarding, are **nowhere near as easy**.

The whole problem is further aggravated by Shipsy **customer support,** that’s often **too little too late to respond**.

Its support team is also notoriously slow to implement custom features and integrations, which is a pretty big deal for businesses looking to manage their entire supply chain.

Finally, **Shipsy offers almost no onboarding materials** that could help beginners wrap their heads around the software’s extensive functionality.

### The verdict

Experienced users probably won’t have much trouble using Shipsy since they’re already well-versed in using similar software and dealing with complex logistics operations.

On the other hand, when it comes to beginners in this space, they’ll have a totally different experience with Shipsy.

Shipsy’s interface can often be too overwhelming for newbies, not only because of Shipsy’s numerous features but also because all the functions, alerts, and data are clustered together.

So, if you’re considering choosing Shipsy, remember that its **customer support tends to be pretty slow in catering to its customers’ needs** and that there are **no comprehensive learning materials**.

Both of these factors work against Shipsy, especially if you’re looking for a simpler, cleaner, and more user-friendly platform.

## Shipsy reviews – Essential functionality

### 1. Options for managing both freight procurement and forwarding

Some of Shipsy’s strongest features are freight procurement and forwarding options.

For example, Shipsy has integrated with more than 50 shipping lines, so finding the best one is greatly simplified for freight forwarders and procurers alike.

Namely, Shipsy connects freight forwarders with **shippers and procurers**, **and vice-versa.**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MTM7G9LFW6bHekaJvDSbNrMfBsVvZrkUOaN0xWA9YX5L-LLbmkCYavLQI7XzIk1sRICSEzFlMU_pjsSVqqgc-legXqysFaiSXj-Xs7RwHwMi2NcNAHHMFkAwgHAFRB7qUpnpLV9K1W-7orFuv2UWMt0pX70G9WLPaAVB4_ynw5SGF1QvwRrkW5GtZA =624x253)

Shipsy – Finding carriers

The first thing Shipsy does is gather and digitize the shipment rates of all the different shipment providers in one place for easy visibility. That enables freight forwarders and procurers to compare all the rates in real-time.

Moreover, Shipsy provides a sort of a job board where **freight forwarders and procurers can post offers** with all the necessary information regarding the load, distance, etc. Because Shipsy integrates with a significant number of shippers, it ensures that users will get bids in the shortest time possible.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PouYm5kOpmMOkDdTeeiXOgm2LiqODkBie7Q4-LoWUO0KKFpZgOQOoqj9T0XmVsiRs2Fc16RtWcIPdSPd4B1FYMmKo66Dn6EmigVmOMCY8B0uC8Y5h32YSjGjFxnXymR8CgsiU1eju8kS8d2YqKiidB-pCxPP0DRQ1sUHYIwI1MJbpxDYGZYQSqmJCA =417x165)

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0KFZhsGeYKugVaJDlv6xwlnRvxrZaWTegLdO-XcHQcQ6cLcoTauQCX6nRLY-ILDmwo8nGGvVk8JPRMsQE2CG-fnPwSOl39xKIABUdoQCHxGyPGUtxcAmelfUrlb2lmtfAlHEtHw1bTA2ptNQZn0YOBVzeEtEFYoB6vyD2FbHErw_H7-Khpbv-Jfavg =420x169)

Shipsy – Bids

In addition, by compiling all the necessary data on shipment rates and requirements, Shipsy enables forwarders to automatically generate a bid for procurers based on:

1. Task-related criteria (e.g., load type and size, transportation means, urgency, etc.)
2. The digitized rates of all the different vendors available for that particular shipment

Forwarders can also automate the booking process thanks to Shipsy’s comprehensive web portal.

In addition, there are options for **tracking each shipment** in real-time that gives insight into all the vital information, like the current location of an order, changes in shippers, predicted ETA, delays, etc.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7PQ0-Nd2M73RfVxyKa4S4OV3PuueSYxEFmpw-6C_l4OP7ZrlZ9COdAGEJc3WBKgmsRxaZXuxIQ5AO4LxKxtMHMbnFJ6QqoIX7v9d2Iw4VSkUTsQ6QgtqaGLZSZw_qyaW1qZqugG4BhZu4zmjlEw-iu0VHpX2RDOgqxA48md5bx62nLRgGIJwVGp08A =642x209)

Shipsy – Tracking shipments

### 2. End-to-end logistics optimization

Shipsy isn’t focused on a single part of the delivery and transportation process. Instead, it aims to cover the entire supply chain – from the manufacturing hubs to stores and, finally, the end customers.

Thanks to a pretty enviable number of different integrations and a comprehensive API, Shipsy provides a single dashboard overview of every part of the entire end-to-end logistics.

The dashboard compiles data from both third-party sources and in-house systems, in addition to enabling things like tracking shipments, gaining insight into ETAs, etc.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/d1S9y5GboG9TKrkqdHVvDxxczEG4tRnNTzkgj84JGXfp1CKN8ihKlDnkqZHxaiDXnMh32CIMwgavkPnF7sNrkB14StDZdaw2jdaApqq1wxbKxhzP5kvFHL3RoO5oQdamtKgYc7cTlunIsx47E7oQSkb4AjiQ-dmsF234TeLphNwgnX5H9wFAqt2qpQ =624x232)

Shipsy – Order dashboard

Moreover, users will get alerts and real-time notifications in case of an emergency, such as delays, demurrages, detentions, and others.

Some of the features that help **Shipsy tackle first, mid, and last-mile transportation** with equal efficiency include:

* Auto-assigning the closest available warehouse and driver to a pickup task
* Auto-sorting items and creating consolidated shipment bags based on the origin and destination hub of each item
* Route planning and optimization capabilities

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WMiO5Spzx0cH-2CS2KsYr4rcO8sp-yvmJ3mQk5YQcY5uUeZFwX0hbLX_-TVj1UtiOXYyXrWWy3XlxOst9LnaFDKBLpJh6jbkolMNUzeHO7ipWDWOKm1hK5IDMb9ziDoXTsU03qMnxoTy9zOYiX-eDm0P_RIODFw4s_cjuKkladdPX740h5mwaRfv6g =231x400)

Shipsy – Routing

* Matching each load with the right kind of vehicle to optimize the number of deliveries per vehicle
* POD collection methods
* Options for easily verifying the reasons for a failed delivery a driver reported directly with the customer via message, email, or call

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jWqhO9Dsp6z76z97mlDZR9QHu47ShBLZC_bGX6ExLuRwcd-V2CXbiv7nsK7eUf4mPQdprtuApvTiEsQsmrXG7bAEKtuHvseeS5O8FNlJoUbdaHtt__4PmEz-evbONuZxzmpDHN_UmRyy2nFi0icn65Ohjfr45s82oVBruKBH778iDlXfPwhit8B2jQ =348x479)

Shipsy – Fake delivery prevention

* Sending links for live-tracking orders to customers

### 3. Finding the most suitable 3PL provider automatically

This is a convenient feature for companies looking to outsource their transportation operations partially or completely.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8tc6GmGM12DIUOznuhX-XzSvCsmlhysgLhlVZPNA5-plKMwIZSvdMGVrDZmiOgqrF7w2sMft8GN6zHcai54Wo3d-sHzUO03JozVgE27AjM_r6acrURXvUcm1BX1VFwpK0iFqCuZWtEiAlXcFcgf_A-Krwup__q7kHWGYalHFh5nQN63LfqoFJA4x3w =624x336)

Shipsy – 3PL providers

With Shipsy, you can **automate the process of finding the best provider** for your needs since you can use multiple filters to narrow your search, such as:

* Number of shipments that will be outsourced
* Maximum number of shipments for a region
* Type of load (e.g., size, cold storage requirements, weight)
* Cost of services
* Performance rates, etc.

Furthermore, you can manage all of your 3PL providers and in-house drivers from a single dashboard for a clean and simple overview.

### The verdict

Shipsy certainly has the functionality necessary for managing the entire supply chain.

Its features (designed for freight forwarders and procurers), capabilities for navigating end-to-end logistics operations, as well as options for finding and managing 3PL providers are all very handy to have, provided you deal with complex logistics in your line of work.

However, as with any other platform, Shipsy is not without its downsides:

* It is pretty **weak regarding customisation options** – to achieve a goal or perform a task, users have to adhere to the pre-set steps with almost no wiggle room
* Shipsy’s **task allocation is less than optimal** when dealing with a larger number of tasks
* Its **reports are often too cluttered and repetitive** on the one hand, while on the other, they do not provide enough necessary data for a complete insight into overall performance and KPIs
* **It takes ages to implement API integration successfully,** and third-party integrations are not exactly seamless
* It seems to be [**fairly expensive**](https://www.g2.com/products/shipsy-shipsy/reviews/shipsy-review-5169574)

Moreover, as mentioned before, [many users are complaining](https://www.g2.com/products/shipsy-shipsy/reviews?utf8=%E2%9C%93&filters%5Bnps_score%5D%5B%5D=3&filters%5Bnps_score%5D%5B%5D=2&filters%5Bnps_score%5D%5B%5D=1&filters%5Bkeyphrases%5D=&order=most_recent&filters%5Bcomment_answer_values%5D=) about the Shipsy support team being too slow to respond and implement new features.

These issues are worth reviewing if you’re seriously considering Shipsy as your go-to solution.

## Shipsy reviews – Pricing

There isn’t much to say about the Shipsy pricing policy since its team has chosen not to publish almost any pricing information.

However, some clues and hints indicate that Shipsy is most definitely not a budget option.

Firstly, Shipsy is a platform for managing the entire supply chain – from when a product leaves the manufacturer to when it’s delivered to the end customer.

This makes **Shipsy a good fit only for the biggest of businesses** that need this wide of a logistics range covered, and such businesses have hefty budgets without exception.

So, by default, **Shipsy simply cannot be a cheap option**.

Secondly, we’ve managed to dig out at least some info about Shipsy’s pricing: its **packages for tracking shipments**.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NiMKtZYC1pzqNIrT4-nbMS4OK7XGK7FyvdDf2CAlAHxfZ_j_qPeht14q8bkgSijNYUj3cDc3qYTNECiqrubIR1Th8gccqiyfe1nD6bV_1whcVxFWbVxObfUKBOR7t4BPs8Q18kecQ7MuObGwuS9MmaUXBB8reXf_5WhM9uKEua2os-PDVtTgMswJQA =624x361)

Shipsy – Tracking pricing

At first glance, this doesn’t seem like too much, especially considering there’s a free plan.

However, remember that this is the pricing for only one of Shipsy’s numerous capabilities.

This means that you would probably have to **pay separately for every segment of functionality with Shipsy**.

Finally, Shipsy is clear about one thing: its **pricing depends mainly on the number and type of features** you want to have access to.

The more advanced your needs are, the more you can expect to pay, as adding every additional feature will cost you.

### The verdict

Although Shipsy doesn’t offer much information regarding its price, we can still draw some conclusions based on what we do know.

Shipsy is aimed towards large enterprises – the biggest of the big players in the transportation and logistics industry. That’s precisely why it probably has a big price tag to match.

Moreover, judging from its tracking plans, **Shipsy probably limits the number of users and containers you get per month**.

Lastly, given that you have to pay separately for every additional feature you want to add to your logistics solution, the costs will probably stack up really high really fast.

## Shipsy reviews – Primary use cases

Shipsy’s core functionality is designed to efficiently take care of end-to-end logistics operations, focusing on shipment procurement, forwarding, and similar tasks.

That’s why **Shipsy is suitable for enterprises alone**, as these types of businesses are the only ones who actually need such features – and have budgets big enough to afford them.

Smaller and medium-sized businesses, as well as all other companies that need more of a last-mile delivery approach, won’t find Shipsy to be a good match.

## Shipsy reviews – Alternative solution

Businesses that need a platform focused on last-mile delivery management and optimization should give eLogii a go. Its clean interface and versatile functionality help users tackle all the challenges of modern-day delivery and transportation logistics.

eLogii has a **wide range of highly-customisable features** that make it a perfect fit for a variety of businesses - from field service providers to retailers, pharmaceutical companies, restaurants, couriers, food & drink delivery services, etc.

Some of its features include:

* Various advanced routing options, including **dynamic**, **multi-day**, and **multi-depot routing**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KDJXOjArLlIrXD_3EYBuLEeKJmJlGLsGpzcKixz8PkxtTVswxxPUHk_aYKpEZMqceRP77g2wvVxECmcIJzSgjnueyu2gelgXcZCgpElNPAd8qKkVjKn-DdEWwsx5Vrw9198HjJU4z_gsFx-iGcQ_lYp4rM591d1Soqp6afMwc8qPytzBwpEda5MG3Q =624x353)

eLogii – Dynamic routing

* Several methods of ensuring customer satisfaction, such as **real-time SMS and/or email notifications** from every stage of the delivery process, **live ETA notifications** (with updated recalculations if something changes on the road), **real-time** **tracking of each order**, etc.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DQgnebDIeLVgP5OHbzd5X2_Ft77KssjP_wr3CPUEaDd_9mX8kJGvVq0WYo3lvKRxmqkG_-wGxN-1p490PL8bnqy_9S_hJQGqeqLyfq-K0GMvIb-ClrsMoz_ZICb5WNMDua6eOLEYdWrj9SZTCWhXJ_wOTyXDmUqZxzd4phP4Bcl-H_Ebm3Qm8ZeqdQ =624x443)

eLogii – Customer notifications

* Numerous **highly customisable operational parameters** that enable tasks such as automated matching of each load with the right type of vehicle, assigning more challenging routes to the most skilled agents, etc.

eLogii – Driver profiles

* **Live tracking of drivers and vehicles** in real-time so you can keep your finger on the pulse of your delivery process anytime, anywhere

eLogii – Live tracking

* **The widest range of POD methods** on the market (including **barcode** and **QR scanning**, among others) – in addition, all of these methods are included even in eLogii’s lowest-tier plan


* A **slick app for drivers** that enables live driver-base and driver-customer communication, provides navigation, simplifies POD collection, etc.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JE3p2kZ0fP63p53VFJI_VpYL98kwp8H1kWRLJaaSK8VkbwVq9H1ZL-nTB5i5BTOHB4beVJQ1WRuot66CzBCAxRtQKrzxaP1eQmD8tmB1B4wE-wQUa6LzEivQVwnRG9F4rvy_9QHMwDGYcW9B-urVG2ZqD5OFQYH7z5RHSgADOlj_fq3mkIpla6yAcg =450x538)

eLogii – Driver app

* A [**well-documented API**](https://api-docs.elogii.com/) integrates seamlessly with all the other tools and technologies you use to manage your supply chain operations

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xdRGDogcRMipPcadBU5JjIVPtRqyNCc2O-rlTVxiRVGTf5M202z3LkJob3zARjNJ4IbhO6jXlbEEwJxNqI5gt0ORgJpDUuBohDabbTywWpFwPtqYng8tpmR-cJmqs630gdDgg2EnnRFVhgb68T6ump7pj0dq-BCsapafm_hgpd3gJP3T-3ihwlky6w =624x428)

eLogii – API

Another one of eLogii’s significant advantages is its pricing policy.

eLogii doesn’t have one-size-fits-all pricing packages, which makes it an **ideal solution for small, medium, and large businesses alike**.

eLogii comes with **custom-tailored pricing plans** based on your business configuration and needs, with the typical entry-level price starting at around $359 per month for 2500 tasks.

Unlike Shipsy, eLogii includes **unlimited users, drivers, and vehicles** in each plan – an excellent option for larger businesses or those aiming to scale.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/S-x2MUGeHJupY5iqDuNesqvQym6CDN3W_-lgOWdwhuSuYwi5RzXqNJMA6IYuez6VBbgi3Fee01kjqOr3slGGy7RZRCpCl_7L-6VtGeB32JkkJfGwKOJPZvjOQzjmAtV6y6MKGlc8mk01kwVvxixR7onKg29vCaRf5AcMMGorfFTA1z44NoWAZVfZ3Q =624x264)

## Shipsy reviews – The bottom line

When it comes to Shipsy, the conclusion is pretty clear and simple:

**Shipsy is an excellent logistics management platform for enterprises** looking to take care of their entire supply chain.

After all, only these types of businesses can take advantage of Shipsy’s rich and somewhat complex functionality.

However, smaller companies, as well as those dealing with last-mile delivery, won’t benefit from Shipsy at all.

They’ll find it too expensive, too difficult to navigate, and won’t be able to make the most of its many features.

Such businesses will be much better off with a solution such as **eLogii** – a dedicated **last-mile delivery platform** that can **easily accommodate the needs of companies of every type, industry, and size**.
