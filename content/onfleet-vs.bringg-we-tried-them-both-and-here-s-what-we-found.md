Today, everything revolves around getting products to your customers as quickly as possible.

For many businesses today, this means offering their customers same-day or next-day delivery options.

Onfleet and Bringg are both delivery management providers that excel in this space, but each has its limitations. To help you make an informed buying decision, we tried both options and provided a thorough comparison in this guide.

We based our comparison on:

* Ease of use
* Key features
* Integrations and APIs
* Pricing
* Use cases
* Customer service and training
* Analytics and reporting

And here's what we found:

## TL;DR

* Onfleet is easy to use and implement. It is best-suited for small businesses needing last-mile delivery.
* Bringg is a great tool for larger companies, those who use third-party logistics companies, and those that want to combine first-mile and last-mile deliveries.
* eLogii is the best delivery management software with a massive number of features, customization options, and flexible pricing plans. It's a perfect choice for businesses of various types and sizes.

## Our approach

To obtain the most reliable data and the deepest understanding of each of these solutions, we took the following steps:

* Tried Onfleet’s free trial and Bringgs’ demo to analyze their features.
* Read through Capterra, G2, and GetApp user reviews, along with those of other top SaaS evaluation sites.
* Put both software to the test in the real world.

And now, let’s get to it!

## Onfleet vs. Bringg – Ease of use

### Onfleet

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nhAS_5o5edRK5V4o45HtbK9Ulsg6y0JM6q8cC2eETQRtRHtAJD84_2_3syEkVBQ61vhk3s38ue3bTFSLsPxDthl9UzTX7Q3havz-E85873DvfWQ_0Wjf5ngGx1aMaEc0uMAOeWU6F6kbS0e_cD9Cw_KCy85V41STB-1bL9ZXuheeFORzfFs9Unh-1xzLqw =624x353)

Onfleet – UI

Onfleet has a **super easy onboarding process and a straightforward user interface**.

The routing algorithm, polished UI/UX, and automatic customer alerts are all standout qualities that contribute to its overall ease of use.

When striving to meet delivery deadlines, the drag-and-drop interface and real-time time estimations can be really awesome.

After jobs are imported, the system will automatically send out deliveries to the best drivers based on their schedules and locations. Incorporating new drivers is simple, and training them is straightforward.

Onfleet has **route optimization software that helps when making route modifications**, such as adding a new stop, switching drivers, or even adding a whole new route to an existing driver's route. This software is equally simple to implement.

Onfleet is **lightning fast**, and the **mobile app is updated regularly with modifications to the automated dispatch software**.

However, some Onfleet users have [reported issues with customer notifications](https://www.g2.com/products/onfleet/reviews/onfleet-review-5186918), as notifications are sometimes missed.

### Bringg

Bringg – UI

Bringg is a comprehensive platform with a wide variety of capabilities to enhance its delivery service to customers. The platform consolidates and simplifies the administration of all delivery-related tasks for all users.

You can **manage all delivery-related tasks from one central location** on the platform: on the dashboard. Information such as shipping and contact information is also presented in an easy-to-find format on the dashboard.

Bringg's driver app has **great calling and messaging capabilities**.

However, Bringg's user interface is poor. Users of the Bringg app have previously reported that the [app randomly crashes](https://www.getapp.com/retail-consumer-services-software/a/bringg/), terminates mid-order, or marks an order as "complete" before they are ready. In one [review](https://www.g2.com/products/bringg/reviews), a client reported that this error caused them to lose customers.

### The verdict

Both Onfleet and Bringg offer a multi-channel experience and have a straightforward onboarding procedure.

A significant drawback of Bringg is its **poor user interface**, which frequently crashes and can result in lost orders and subpar delivery management procedures.

And while Onfleet's user interface is excellent, **customers don't always receive delivery notifications**. These drawbacks limit the quality of Onfleet's delivery system.

## Onfleet vs. Bringg – Key features

### Onfleet

Onfleet has the following key features:

* **Customizable dashboards** – Onfleet offers customizable reports and dashboards to give users insight into their orders and drivers. Users can also track drivers’ performance and assign new tasks.

* **Route optimization –** Onfleet automatically considers time, location, vehicle capacity, and traffic to recommend the most optimized routes for delivering packages. Drivers receive instant text message updates if anything changes. Onfleet allows business owners to see what routes their drivers are taking and how many miles they are traveling.

* **Auto-dispatching – Onfleet automates the process of sending fleets along predetermined routes, saving time and effort for businesses and reducing the number of drivers needed to carry out delivery operations.**

* **Electronic Proof of Delivery (ePOD) – Onfleet provides a mobile app for drivers to fill out ePODs. This app collects photos, signatures, barcodes, and notes and then instantly transmits the data back to your organization's administrators. However, only the more expensive packages include premium features like age verification and barcode scanning.**

* **Predictive ETAs – Onfleet has a machine learning-enhanced program that gives real-time alerts and accurate predictions of arrival times. Not only do customers get ETA updates for their packages, but they also get automated SMS notifications when certain events occur (for example, when a delivery process is initiated, when a driver arrives, when a driver is done, etc.) However, Onfleet does not allow you to send email notifications; only SMS notifications (and these cost extra).**

* **Driver chat – Onfleet users have access to a secure, private chat platform designed specifically for businesses. Here, they can open lines of communication with all team members.**

* **Real-time tracking – Dispatchers and administrators can easily track drivers with Onfleet's responsive web tracking experience.**

* **Last mile reporting – You can track success rates, on-time performance, servicing times, customer satisfaction ratings, mileage, and more with Onfleet. You can also easily export your data and create reports.**

### Bringg

* **Driver management system** – You can relay precise customer instructions to drivers via call.

* **Live tracking facility** – This feature tells you where drivers are in real-time and updates clients on the status of their orders and when they can expect delivery.

* **Proof of Delivery (POD) Collection** – Bringg helps guarantee POD precision by recording client signatures, barcodes, photographs, etc. It can also receive customer feedback.

* **Job management** – Bringg can help larger courier companies that use a combination of in-house and independent drivers to coordinate the delivery of customer orders.

* **Route optimization** – Bringg enables automatic dispatching and optimizes routes automatically. By using route optimization, it is possible to eliminate delays in delivery caused by traffic and construction zones.

* **Inventory tracking** – From the time your warehouse receives a product to the time it's delivered by the driver, Bringg keeps track of each package's whereabouts using a barcode scanner.

* **Customized dashboard tabs** – You can create customized dashboards to monitor drivers and orders and to track different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including team output, driver ratings, and delivery success.

### The verdict

Bringg and Onfleet both provide similar features (such as driver management, route optimization, real-time visibility, analytics, POD collection, etc.).

However, Bringg is an enterprise-level product that provides supply chain management. If you are a large company with an integrated supply chain and delivery operation, it can do much more than Onfleet to optimize your activities.

It's also worth noting that Onfleet's base subscription does not cover barcode scanning, even though this is a vital POD method.

To take advantage of the barcode scanning feature, even the smallest firms will have to choose from one of the two more expensive Onfleet packages. Since these businesses presumably won't require as many activities, purchasing one of these plans isn't a good investment.

## Onfleet vs. Bringg – Integrations and API

### Onfleet

Onfleet integrates with a **variety of third-party platforms, including Slack, Salesforce, Google Sheets, and various eCommerce platforms**, so that you can easily launch, migrate, or manage operations on multiple channels.

It also integrates with **Zapier**. If you don't have a development team, you can still connect tools, push deliveries, and trigger notifications efficiently with Zapier.

### Bringg

Bringg's open **API allows it to be integrated with tools like Salesforce and other fleet management solutions.** Teams making deliveries who deal with orders from different sources may find this useful.

Unfortunately, the Bringg API is **not always the easiest to use**. Developing integrations on Bringg is quite complex and slow.

Many fundamental software features are also difficult to tailor to individual needs, and there are numerous discrepancies in Bringg's documentation.

### The verdict

Onfleet has a better integration process than Bringg.

## Onfleet vs. Bringg – Pricing

### Onfleet

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/z3hiJnBchhYiXBUydO_OHXx3P8Hn6T4bmjJZ8gtP3HrSCTXy3eE7rzlgsRQTvCPug41j8nhEw6uBdu8XOBRcnBTiCBdp1oaLcch7rInM1dGV4KpcL8t9pMWJAem2nlf4wGUBWnASaVfL9EPkDSJFiI1HbTwZaS_84AnS9GMvxvFEcM9FqdbA-tGeTeRI7g =624x353)

Onfleet – Pricing

Onfleet offers three pricing tiers:

* **Basic:** $349 a month with 2,500 tasks

With this plan, you can use features like API integration with billing and invoicing systems, route optimization, and driver chat between drivers and dispatchers.

* **Premium**: $799 a month with 5,000 tasks

With this plan, you can scan barcodes at both the point of delivery and pickup. In addition, drivers can get unique phone numbers that clients can use to get in touch with them. The premium package also includes a dedicated support agent and expedited email responses.

* **Professional**: This costs $1999 a month with 12,500 tasks

You get premium service, complete access to driver analytics data, and more at this pricing tier.

If you have a small delivery team, the flat cost offered by Onfleet can make it far more expensive long-term. For instance, with four drivers, the monthly premium plan costs $799 (or around $144 per driver per month). That could be expensive for a startup, especially because this price point has a minimum one-year commitment with no wiggle room if Onfleet doesn't meet your requirements.

### Bringg

Bringg doesn't offer a free trial or distinct pricing tiers because its services are c**ustomized to meet the unique demands of each organization**.

On their website, there is a form you can fill out that asks you how many deliveries you make each month, ranging from zero to four. This implies that there might be a sliding scale fee based on your answer.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CPPCuIqfYNoY5bdh_GzFAnhMUxoW-dFf2YYPMFgk40m-n1sc-6IaDQ1_JCk22X5nWWKAf73CSCZ1QMJuG2cPCT_e02stzuzDbLk_MAWP0GMCoSeD89fR519X2GF1RCFf6nsQ3ts-m6N0TYCeubzKuAclPVDiD2hrf8KixIcQlILlhpNZTz57dIixFK0AHg =624x497)

Bringg – Pricing

### The verdict

Companies with a sizable fleet will benefit most from Onfleet's premium programs. When you have only three or four drivers, it's not cost-effective.

With lower Onfleet plans, you'll only get mediocre delivery that won't impress your clients. You'll also need to contend with challenges like the absence of a barcode scanner in the starter package.

We can't price Bringg, but it's realistic to expect that Bringg's pricing will be higher than Onfleet's due to Bringg's integrated supply chain elements.

Furthermore, 30,000 is considered to be the bare minimum for jobs on Bringg. This is significantly higher than Onfleet (where the number ranges from 2000 to 3000). This also supports the idea that Bringg costs more than Onfleet.

## Onfleet vs. Bringg – Use cases

### Onfleet

**Small enterprises that don't need a high volume of monthly activities and can get by without more sophisticated delivery optimization features would benefit most from Onfleet.**

Smaller businesses that outsource some of their deliveries and need the ability to subcontract other organizations might also find Onfleet useful.

### Bringg

**Bringg is primarily aimed at large enterprises in the retail, food and grocery, and healthcare industries.** Their customers include Walmart, the Co-Op, Coca-Cola, and KFC.

Bringg is also useful for large brands that need to integrate on-demand delivery with supply chain management.

### Bottom line

Onfleet is suitable for mid-size organizations. Larger companies with more complex needs will require a more extensive platform like eLogii or Bringg.

## Onfleet vs. Bringg – Customer service and training

### Onfleet

The **lack of real-time technical support** from Onfleet can be problematic in the event of an emergency. **Onfleet only offers support via email** (which isn't exactly the speediest approach because you have to wait for a response).

However, as an alternative to live phone-based support, Onfleet lets you schedule a certain number of support calls per month based on your plan type.

It's also relatively easy to onboard drivers on Onfleet and train them to use the app.

### Bringg

Like Onfleet, Bringg's customer service is **limited to email correspondence**. As previously mentioned, this can be inefficient and have a negative impact on your company in the event of an emergency.

### The verdict

The lack of dedicated live customer service and the inability to provide immediate help is a major flaw shared by Onfleet and Bringg.

## Onfleet vs. Bringg – Analytics and reporting

### Onfleet

Onfleet places a **strong emphasis on analytics** because the data it collects is useful not just for drivers but also for administrators and dispatchers.

With Onfleet, you can keep tabs on your vehicles' whereabouts in real time, as well as view reports on each driver's efficiency. With these metrics, you can have a constant, high-level overview of your drivers' activities.

Onfleet – Reporting

In addition, drivers have quick and easy access to their whole task history, which includes:

* A summary of average task duration, average travel distance, and average service duration
* The ratio of timely-to-late jobs
* Range traveled
* Travel time and duty hours (in transit vs. idle)

### Bringg

The analytics dashboard in Bringg allows you to keep an eye on your KPIs using a variety of helpful graphical widgets. This information can help you work more effectively, spend less money, and impress executives when giving reports.

For instance, you can determine cost-effective business methods by comparing the percentage of on-time deliveries made between two different periods.

However, it is **tough to organize, break down, and decipher performance reports** on Bringg.

### The verdict

Onfleet and Bringg both have extensive analytics and reporting capabilities. However, it's not easy to interpret analytics and performance reports on either tool.

## Onfleet vs. Bringg. Vs. eLogii

The ability to monitor shipments in real-time, provide invaluable insights, and ensure that products are delivered to customers in a timely and cost-effective manner are the best qualities of an A-list delivery management system.

Onfleet and Bringg are great delivery systems, **but they will quickly become too pricey for businesses with smaller fleets.**

Those operating more extensive fleets should also be aware of the potential for Bringg's software glitches and integration complications to interrupt deliveries. Additionally, neither solution offers phone-based customer support (only email).

eLogii is the **superior choice for delivery management for businesses of any size or type because it's both feature-rich and easily scalable.**

With eLogii, you have the strength of Bringg and the ease of use of Onfleet, plus a lot more.
