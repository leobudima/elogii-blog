FleetUp is a fleet and equipment management platform with lots of features and quite a few devices that enable FleetUp to deliver high-level performance.

If you’re wondering whether FleetUp could be the best fit for your specific needs, you’ll need in-depth information on its:

* User experience
* Best functions
* Pricing policy
* Primary use cases

And that’s exactly the kind of info we’ll deliver here since we researched FleetUp from top to bottom.

As a bonus, we’ll suggest an alternative solution for businesses that don’t find FleetUp to be a good match.

## TLDR

* FleetUp is a fleet management platform that differs from similar software as it has a clean and simple interface that’s fairly easy to navigate
* In addition to the usual set of fleet management features, FleetUp has options for equipment and workforce management, container and shipment protection, and engine diagnostics
* FleetUp is the best choice for businesses that need a solution for remote monitoring, management, and coordination of both fleet and equipment
* Since FleetUp lacks the functionality for comprehensive delivery management and optimization, companies looking for a last-mile delivery solution will be better off with eLogii
* eLogii is an all-around delivery management platform whose cutting-edge features and high scalability make it the perfect choice for businesses of various kinds and sizes

## FleetUp reviews – Research methodology

FleetUp doesn’t have a free trial, so we weren’t able to take it for a test drive personally, but we did the next best thing.

First, we’ve interviewed a number of past and current users to find out which features they considered FleetUp’s strongest and weakest points.

Second, we’ve read all the customer reviews on reputable SaaS rating websites such as Capterra, GetApp, and G2 to get a more comprehensive idea of FleetUp’s pros, cons, and use cases.

And given that we have developed a delivery management platform ourselves, we knew exactly what features to pay special attention to when reviewing FleetUp.

Let’s begin by analysing FleetUp’s overall user experience.

## FleetUp reviews – User experience

Unlike most other [fleet management software](https://elogii.com/blog/benefits-of-fleet-management-systems/), FleetUp is **surprisingly easy to use**.

![FleetUp UI](/blog/uploads/fleetup-ui.JPG "FleetUp UI")

Although its interface may not have a particularly eye-catching design, it’s still clean and very simple to navigate.

Moreover, most of FleetUp’s devices, such as dashcams, temperature monitors, ELDs, etc., are easy to set up and install. In fact, most don’t even require any particular technical expertise.

On the other hand, FleetUp doesn’t offer many learning resources, having only short how-to articles on very few topics.

However, FleeetUp compensates for this downside by offering comprehensive onboarding and one-on-one training sessions for its clients.

When it comes to FleetUp’s customer support, most reviews speak rather favourably about it, with just a couple of low ratings.

### The verdict

Most of FleetUp’s features are pretty simple to figure out, even for less advanced users.

Its customer support is also spot-on, as it’s very responsive and quick to react.

The only few things that could be somewhat improved are the aesthetics component of the interface design and the learning resources which are presently far too limited.

## FleetUp reviews – Best features

### 1. Equipment management options

In addition to fleet management, FleetUp also has equipment management features.

Basically, **anything with an engine can be monitored and managed** by FleetUp’s devices, such as bulldozers, tractors, bobcats, cranes, and everything in between.

![FleetUp Asset information](/blog/uploads/fleetup-asset-information.png "FleetUp Asset information")

These options are especially useful for managers overseeing more than one job site or when remote monitoring and control are needed.

Some of FleetUp’s equipment management functions include:

* 10-second data updates, meaning that the device you’ve installed in an asset will check for changes in all the vital stats and upload the data to FleetUp’s dashboard
* Live-tracking each asset’s location anytime, anywhere (provided there’s a network signal, of course)
* Sending real-time alerts and notifications in case of unauthorized use, the equipment being turned off before the end of working hours, or theft
* Providing insight into how much each asset is used. This data can help users see what pieces are eroding their budgets due to less-than-optimal or irresponsible use

### 2. Container and shipment protection

Cargo and vehicle theft is every fleet manager’s nightmare. That’s why FleetUp designed devices and features to help prevent such unfortunate events, such as:

* Sending **immediate alerts** whenever there’s an attempted container break-in
* SMS and instant dashboard notifications in case the cargo is removed from its designated container. This also enables **easy traceability** and prevents shipment misplacing
* **Remote door locking** and **engine shut-offs** for optimal security
* **Real-time GPS location** of each asset that’s updated every 10 seconds

![FleetUp Asset monitoring](/blog/uploads/fleetup-asset-monitoring.JPG "FleetUp Asset monitoring")

* Dynamic geofencing enables users to create borders in all the areas that matter, add custom rules, and be notified when and if an asset leaves or enters the area

### 3. Workforce management

FleetUp tries its best to be more than just another fleet management software by including functions that enable workforce management as well.

And it actually does a pretty decent job at it by providing several nifty features like:

* Accurate, up-to-date **monitoring of employee work hours**, so you’ll instantly know how much you owe each and will be able to pinpoint when there’s a false overtime claim
* Enabling drivers to fill out and submit electronic DVIRs easily

![FleetUp DVIR](/blog/uploads/fleetup-dvir.JPG "FleetUp DVIR")

* Automatically turn data collected by GPS and FleetUp’s mobile apps into payroll reports. This way, you eliminate human error factors, mistakes, miscalculations, and fraudulent claims
* Live monitoring and in-cab coaching of each driver. Moreover, the ELD device will keep track of irregular and risky driving behaviors, so you’ll know what each driver has to improve on
* A dual-facing dashcam. All the events the dashcam records are stored and tagged by risk level for easy navigation

![FleetUp Dashcam](/blog/uploads/fleetup-dashcam.JPG "FleetUp Dashcam")

In addition, FleetUp enables users to provide their business partners and clients with higher visibility and workflow transparency thanks to its trip-sharing option.

This means you can share the entire journey with everyone who needs to know – from customers to stakeholders, brokers, and partners.

The best part is that you can share all the essential details, such as:

* ETAs
* Every step of the route a vehicle has taken
* Driver HOS status
* Fuel level
* Real-time GPS location
* When vehicles were in different areas along the trip
* Average and current vehicle speed, etc.

### 4. Engine health monitoring

Keeping track of vehicle and equipment engine health is another crucial part of a fleet manager’s job.

This ensures optimal safety for everyone involved and reduces the risk of a minor mechanical issue blowing up into a costly disaster.

FleetUp enables you to **anticipate any engine-related problems** in vehicles and equipment alike, as it constantly monitors and checks the engines for any discrepancies, anomalies, and indications of trouble.

As soon as a FleetUp device notices something out of the ordinary, it notifies users, allowing them to take immediate action.

![FleetUp Notifications _ alerts setup](/blog/uploads/fleetup-notifications-_-alerts-setup.png "FleetUp Notifications _ alerts setup")

You can also schedule minor repairs and regular maintenance check-ups to prevent more severe breakdowns.

### The verdict

FleetUp is a much more sophisticated solution compared to other fleet management software.

Its equipment and workforce management features, in particular, give it a definite edge over similar platforms.

However, there are also some downsides to FleetUp that must be noted:

* Its **reporting capabilities are pretty weak**. It’s difficult to find and pull the reports you need, and they often do not provide enough necessary information

![FleetUp Reports](/blog/uploads/fleetup-reports.JPG "FleetUp Reports")

* FleetUp **cannot be used** to the fullest extent **in rural and areas with a low signal**, as this completely wrecks its tracking features

Moreover, although FleetUp does an excellent job at the things it was designed to do, you should not expect it to do more than that.

Namely, **FleetUp is not to be used as a delivery management and optimization tool** since it simply lacks the necessary functionality for it, such as:

* Comprehensive POD collection methods
* Failed delivery workflows
* Advanced customer satisfaction features

## FleetUp reviews – Pricing

FleetUp’s pricing policy is a bit of a mystery.

FleetUp chose not to publish precise information on its pricing policy, which isn’t that rare in this industry. Still, it is somewhat strange that FleetUp’s team didn’t even specify things like:

* Whether they charge on a per-asset basis and if there are any bulk discounts
* If a minimum number of vehicles is required for signing a contract
* If contracts are exclusively long-term or not, etc.

This is why we cannot judge how competitive its pricing is compared to similar platforms.

What we do know for sure is that FleetUp has 4 packages for fleet management, 3 for asset management, and 2 for equipment management, respectively.

We suppose that each of these plans is **priced and charged separately**.

Moreover, we guess that FleetUp’s **pricing does depend on your fleet size**, at least to a certain extent, judging by its quote request form.

![FleetUp Quote request](/blog/uploads/fleetup-quote-request.JPG "FleetUp Quote request")

As seen above, one of the bits of information prospective users need to provide is the fleet size they’d like to manage with FleetUp.

Finally, based on our previous reviews of similar fleet management software, such as [Eroad](https://elogii.com/blog/eroad-reviews/) and [Fleet Complete](https://elogii.com/blog/fleet-complete-reviews/), we can assume that FleetUp is also pretty expensive.

### The verdict

Although we cannot make any definite conclusions based on the very scarce information we have at our disposal, we can make a few assumptions:

1. FleetUp’s pricing plans probably depends on a business’s fleet size in one way or another
2. Users are likely charged separately for each plan they want to use (i.e., companies that need both fleet and equipment management will probably have to buy at least 2 plans)
3. Judging by the priciness of similar software options, it’s to be expected that FleetUp is also on the more expensive end of the spectrum

## FleetUp reviews – Who is FleetUp for?

FleetUp is designed for fleet and equipment management and tracking, and in this regard, it really does a first-rate job.

Despite having a lot of different functions – and devices to support those functions – FleetUp is unexpectedly simple to use, which is another advantage, especially once you compare it to similar platforms.

Consequently, FleetUp is an excellent choice for businesses needing a solution that can help them **track, monitor, and manage their fleet**.

Moreover, its equipment-oriented features make **FleetUp ideal for businesses that own various kinds of equipment** and need a hand with overseeing and navigating it remotely.

Since FleetUp doesn’t provide precise info on its pricing policy, we cannot tell you for sure what size business would make up FleetUp’s ideal users. You’ll have to contact its team directly to get a quote for your business and see whether it works for you or not.

However, you should know that FleetUp cannot extend over and above its fleet management functionality. This means that **it does not provide advanced delivery management** options.

So if you’re looking for a delivery management & optimization platform, you should think about finding a different solution altogether.

## FleetUp reviews – Best alternative

Businesses requiring a delivery management and optimization platform will find that eLogii, with its numerous and versatile functionality, could be their ultimate solution.

eLogii is a comprehensive delivery management and optimization platform that helps users tackle all the challenges of modern-day delivery and transportation logistics.

![eLogii dynamic routing](/blog/uploads/elogii-dynamic-routing.png "eLogii dynamic routing")

![eLogii customer notifications](/blog/uploads/elogii-customer-notifications.JPG "eLogii customer notifications")

* Numerous **highly customisable operational parameters** which enable tasks such as automated matching of each load with the right type of vehicle, assigning more challenging routes to the most skilled agents, etc.

![eLogii vehicle configuration](/blog/uploads/elogii-vehicle-configuration.JPG "eLogii vehicle configuration")

![live tracking](/blog/uploads/live-tracking.png "live tracking")

* **The widest range of POD methods** on the market (including **barcode** and **QR scanning**, among others) – in addition, all of these methods are included even in eLogii’s lowest-tier plan
* **Failed delivery workflows** to instruct drivers what to do if they cannot find the end customer at the delivery location (e.g., you can allow leaving it with a neighbour, or returning it to the depot, etc.)

![eLogii failed delivery workflow](/blog/uploads/elogii-failed-delivery-workflow.JPG "eLogii failed delivery workflow")

* A [**well-documented API**](https://api-docs.elogii.com/) integrates seamlessly with all the other tools and technologies you use to manage your supply chain operations

![eLogii API](/blog/uploads/elogii-api.png "eLogii API")

When it comes to its pricing, eLogii doesn’t publish off-the-peg prices (ditto for FleetUp). However, eLogii is much more transparent and precise regarding the criteria on which it bases its exact pricing.

eLogii comes with **custom-tailored pricing plans** based on your business’s particular configuration and needs, with typical entry-level price starting at around $359 per month for 2500 tasks.

Each plan includes **unlimited users, drivers, and vehicles** - an excellent option for larger businesses or those aiming to scale.

![elogii pricing](/blog/uploads/elogii-pricing.png "elogii pricing")

The fact that eLogii doesn’t have one-size-fits-all pricing packages is one of the things that make it an **ideal solution for small, medium, and large businesses alike**.

You can [compare each plan’s features](https://elogii.com/plans-and-features?utm_content=Cj0KCQjwidSWBhDdARIsAIoTVb3rzMUA0BtUIPyXleIaPk7ODhqHDEWXrpWW_HCGKoi2omXmaU7DErUaAuT1EALw_wcB) on its webpage for a detailed overview of what each eLogii package includes.

## FleetUp reviews – The bottom line

As we’ve seen, **FleetUp** is a pretty **advanced solution for fleet and equipment management**.

Whereas most similar platforms are somewhat outdated and one-sided in their fleet management approach, FleetUp has many very versatile features and a well-designed interface. All told, this delivers an excellent overall user experience.

However, FleetUp cannot be used as a substitute for a comprehensive delivery management platform because that functionality is simply out of its range, which is already broad enough as it is.

So, businesses that need something other than fleet and equipment management – something designed for efficiently tackling all the challenges of contemporary last-mile delivery – would be wise to opt for eLogii.

eLogii is a **scalable** and **feature-rich solution** with a **flexible pricing policy**, which makes it **ideal for businesses of all types and sizes**.
