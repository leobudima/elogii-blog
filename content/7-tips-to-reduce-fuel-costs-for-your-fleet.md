Fleet fuel costs are a huge expense for transportation companies.

According to the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/prices.html), gasoline prices alone rose by 145% just in the past couple of years – something that has put a substantial strain on fleet budgets.

Geopolitical strife, market instability, a changing climate environment, and fuel price volatility have also created the perfect storm for fleet managers to maneuver.

You aren’t alone with these obstacles, but you can get ahead of your competition with just a few updates to your operations.

There are many strategies that transportation companies can employ to survive a turbulent economy, improve fuel efficiency, and reduce fuel costs. In this article, we’ll discuss seven effective ways to save money on fuel prices. Many of these tips are simple and easy to implement immediately.

Here’s a summary of our main tactics below.

## How rising fuel costs hurt businesses

Rising fuel costs will add up quickly, especially if there are other organizational inefficiencies at play.

There’s not much you can do about market fluctuations. But you can address the factors that are making your fuel bills higher than they need to be.

Just quickly, some of these factors include:

* **Driver behavior** – Closely evaluate driver behavior, such as aggressive driving, jackrabbit starts (which is a term for rapid acceleration from a standstill), speeding, and idling. These bad practices could be a sizable source of fuel waste.
* **Fuel fraud** – Paying for expensive fuel that never gets used is a fleet manager’s worst nightmare. Fuel fraud can happen in many forms. Fuel siphoning by fleet staff, fuel theft by scammers, and non-fuel purchases are just some examples.
* **An aging fleet** – Driving an older fleet means you’re using more fuel compared to newer, more fuel-efficient fleet vehicles.
* **Maintenance** – A fleet that isn’t well-maintained will use more fuel because of reduced efficiency and performance. Ensure that regular maintenance tasks are completed, including oil changes and tire rotations.
* **Technology gaps** – Implementing fleet management software can help your fleet managers track fuel usage and identify areas of improvement.

In the next section, we’ll cover seven specific solutions to these fleet fuel challenges and provide tips on how to reduce fuel consumption.

## Tips to reduce your fuel fleet costs

The most efficient and cost-effective ways to reduce fleet fuel costs may include some rethinking of your operations.

### #2. Embrace telematics

Gone are the days when you were left in the dark about your deliveries until the driver got back to the depo.

Telematics is a fleet management tool that provides fleet managers with real-time data about their fleet activity.

It involves using sensors to monitor every stage of your fleet’s movement, from vehicle ignition to final destination. Simply put, you get to have your eye on every vehicle at all times as if you were there with them.

Using telematics is a crucial step in identifying areas where fuel consumption could be reduced.

For example, fleet managers can identify drivers that are frequently idling or speeding and then take action to correct these behaviors. You also see whether or not drivers are in the vehicle by following the progress of each route live.

As the popular saying goes, if it gets measured, it gets managed.

Telematics, specifically the version of it that eLogii has, provides a proactive monitoring solution that can help you become more fuel efficient and improve fleet performance through targeted action. Ask us about it during your demo with our team.

### #3. Upgrade inefficient vehicles

Upgrading your fleet is an effective strategy for riding out rising fleet costs and future-proofing your company before it’s too late.

This can include investing in electric vehicles or even hybrid ones. Simply upgrading your fleet with newer models that have better fuel consumption could also work.

Another option is to consider alternative fuels like biodiesel or compressed natural gas. These can help reduce fleet fuel costs while also limiting your fleet’s carbon footprint.

The adoption of electric vehicles has accelerated in the past few years. Fleet giants like UPS [have already invested](https://about.ups.com/sg/en/social-impact/environment/climate/renewed-focus-on-renewable-energy.html) in sustainable vehicles. They also deploy more than 12,000 low-emission vehicles around the world.

By taking a proactive approach and improving your fleet’s fuel efficiency, you can not only reduce fuel costs but also set a good example for eco-conscious customers who care about the carbon footprint created by their deliveries or supply chain legs.

### #4. Establish a regular vehicle maintenance system

Do you regularly perform a thorough check on your entire fleet? Or only when something is wrong?

Investing the time to look through your fleet will ensure optimal performance in the long run. According to the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/04/f74/omguide_complete_w-eo-disclaimer.pdf) (specifically, see page 51.), preventive maintenance could lead to as much as 12% to 18% in cost savings when compared to reactive maintenance.

A fleet maintenance system involves regularly inspecting fleet vehicles for signs of wear and tear, performing routine repairs as needed (even something as small as tire pressure checks), and replacing components that are past their prime.

Adding a fleet maintenance program to your operations can save you thousands of dollars in costs from preventable breakdowns and other problems down the road.

To create such a system, first, consult with fleet maintenance experts to learn more about the best practices for fleet maintenance. Then, work with your drivers and staff to establish clear guidelines and expectations around fleet upkeep.

Alternatively, you can also implement telematics and make use of the predictive maintenance features.

### #5. Consider low rolling resistance tires

Low rolling resistance tires are an easy way to reduce fleet fuel consumption because they reduce the energy required to propel your vehicles forward.

Implementing these types of tires is like having physics on your side. Rolling resistance is the force that opposes motion when a rubber tire rolls on any surface, including concrete and pavement.

Low rolling resistance tires are designed with lower-friction materials (compared to traditional rubber tires). This makes them more efficient.

By switching your fleet’s regular tires out for low rolling versions, you may see a reduction in fleet fuel costs over time.

It’s a simple investment that can have a big impact on your bottom line. To find out how big this impact can be, try [Michelin’s rolling resistance comparison tool](https://business.michelinman.com/tips-suggestions/pressure-calculation-tools/rolling-resistance-comparison) or a [general low rolling resistance calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/rolling-resistance).

### #6. Train drivers to optimize fuel consumption

Drivers are your first line of defense when it comes to fleet fuel efficiency. Training drivers to optimize fuel consumption is an easy way to lower fuel costs on a company level.

Conducting regular driver evaluations will help you improve fuel economy and offer targeted training as needed.

Driver training focuses on best practices like accelerating gradually, avoiding hard braking, sticking to speed limits, and avoiding heavy traffic areas whenever possible. When fleet drivers are properly trained, they become more aware of their driving habits and how they impact the fleet’s fuel consumption.

We must note that driving can be a charged subject for many. So how do you deal with drivers who are resistant to training?

One effective strategy is to keep drivers engaged and motivated throughout the training process.

Be sure to acknowledge highlights from their tenure, as well as promote the positive impacts of fleet fuel efficiency as the next milestone for them to achieve. Emphasize the importance of lower emissions and a reduction in vehicle wear and tear.

Additionally, you can run fleet fuel efficiency contests and offer staff prizes or other rewards for good performance.

Training will not only improve fleet operations overall but will also bring your staff fresh motivation.

### #7. Reduce idle time

Idle fleet vehicles may seem like a small issue, but they can add up to high costs over time. Fleet fuel consumption is highest when engines run but the vehicle isn’t moving.

Excessive idling is a common issue among fleet drivers who may be accustomed to sitting and waiting at job sites or other locations. However, idle fleet vehicles can quickly eat up precious fuel.

The first thing you can do is measure performance. Use fleet management software like eLogii that [automatically logs vehicle movement](https://elogii.com/capabilities/live-operations) and alerts managers of any patterns of inactivity.

Equipped with the right data, fleet managers can work with fleet drivers to reduce the amount of time vehicles spend idling. This includes things like encouraging drivers to turn off engines when stopping for long periods or getting managers to adjust schedules to better match fleet driver activity.

Establish company rules around fleet vehicle idling and ensure this information is accessible for new hires.

## Final thoughts: Ways to reduce fleet fuel costs

The seven strategies we presented are based on data and best practices. Subsequently, they can help improve fleet fuel efficiency and reduce fleet costs over time.

Whether you’re looking to reduce fleet fuel consumption through training drivers, implementing LRR tires, or reducing idle time, you can make a big difference in your bottom line.

And by investing in fleet driver training and utilizing fleet management tools like eLogii, you can bring your fleet operations to the next level and reduce fleet costs no matter how the market swings.
