Let’s get started.

## What Are Last-Mile Delivery Logistics?

Last-mile delivery logistics are a series of processes and activities that enable companies to distribute and move goods across supply chains and to customers and to fulfill their orders.

Logistics of last-mile delivery has one goal: **to deliver the product as fast as possible.**

## Why Are Last-Mile Delivery Logistics Important?

Last-mile delivery has been the lifeline that’s been able to drive the global economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In fact, [**according to a study by McKinsey**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-transport-and-logistics/our-insights/how-customer-demands-are-reshaping-last-mile-delivery), the cost of global parcel delivery, excluding pickup, line-haul, and sorting, amounts to €70 billion.

Three countries: Germany, China, and the United States, account for more than **40% of the market**.

So delivery logistics don’t just drive growth at the company level. They also drive market expansion at the global level.

## Why Is Last-Mile Delivery Difficult?

Last mile delivery is difficult to manage because it requires at least four different elements for it to work:

1\. Structure

2\. Processes

3\. People

4\. Technology

All of these four elements also require a lot of resources, while not churning too much profit in return.

At the same time, major players in e-Commerce, such as Amazon and Walmart, and [**the state of delivery during the coronavirus**](https://elogii.com/blog/the-state-of-delivery-in-time-of-the-coronavirus/), have brought about new consumer expectations.

From fulfillment speed, through new delivery options like [**curbside pickup and delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/curbside-pickup-and-delivery/), to demand for low-cost and even free delivery, all of it is making it difficult for SMBs to keep up.

Then, there is the question of efficiency in last-mile logistics. Or how to reduce the amount of resources you spend fulfilling each order.

Plus, unpredictable elements that may occur and disrupt operations, and which businesses can’t control.

Businesses that offer delivery need to take all of this into consideration. But also the fact that they’re not the only players in the last-mile delivery services game.

Competition is high. And as more and more companies move into the online marketplace, it will only get higher.

## Last-Mile Delivery Challenges

The last mile is the last leg of the delivery process.

Typically, every delivery process starts from the distribution center or hub and ends at the customer’s doorsteps.

The final-mile delivery can vary from a few blocks to 50 or sometimes even 100 miles.

The internet has transformed traditional retail into e-commerce.

That change brought along a change in customer's shopping habits.

Nowadays, everyone wants their delivery as soon as possible. In fact,

[**88% of consumers**](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey.html) don’t mind paying an additional fee if it means they will receive their order faster.

Additionally, when you think of the state of delivery in time of coronavirus, you can imagine that solving last-mile delivery logistics becomes even more challenging.

To explain it even better we'll go through the top 7 challenges in last-mile logistics.

### #1 Consumer Behaviour

E-commerce and the other factors that make last-mile delivery difficult have brought about a [**shift in consumer shopping habits and behaviors**](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-great-consumer-shift-ten-charts-that-show-how-us-shopping-behavior-is-changing).

One of the top reasons for this is **the fast development of new technologies**.

E-commerce shopping provides customers with a chance to compare several products at the same time from the comfort of their homes.

The expectations are higher than ever, they are demanding in terms of customization as well as product differentiation.

### #2 Poor Infrastructure

A common challenge in last-mile delivery logistics is **poor infrastructure**. This has both to do with modern urban infrastructure and business structures that support last-mile delivery.

On the one hand, the rise in demand for delivery services has increased the amount of traffic in urban areas.

More vehicles on the road means more traffic congestion. And that translates into higher [**transportation costs**](https://elogii.com/blog/transportation-costs/).

On the other hand, it’s difficult to fulfill orders in cities without adequate fulfillment centers.

And, as there is a lack of space in cities, the high real-estate costs mean it’s difficult for SMBs to get a hold of these storage facilities so that they can handle [**urban delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-routing-in-cities/).

### #3 High Delivery Costs

High delivery costs is another challenge of final-mile logistics.

Companies have to spend a lot of money to fulfill orders, while often getting low returns. Or, in some cases, not getting any returns due to free delivery.

_Read this article if you want to know_ [**_how to offer free delivery to your customers_**](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-offer-free-delivery-to-your-customers/).

But last-mile delivery logistics costs are expensive for both customer and business.

Setting up an infrastructure that supports modern deliveries can be costly, especially same-day delivery.

The expectation of same-day deliveries has had a big impact on the budget of SMBs and big names in e-commerce.

In fact, [**28% of the entire delivery cost**](https://shipware.com/blog/what-is-last-mile-logistics/#:\~:text=Understanding%20the%20Costs%20of%20Last,of%20a%20shipment's%20total%20costs.) actually comes from the last mile.

Shipping and logistics companies also have to allocate additional funds to failed deliveries, e-commerce returns, and any unexpected events that hinder accurate order fulfillment.

For customers, high delivery costs directly lead to an increase in cart abandonment rates.

In fact, research shows that [**55% of customers**](https://www.annexcloud.com/blog/31-shopping-cart-abandonment-statistics-for-2021/) abandon their shopping carts if presented with an extra shipping cost.

### #4 Transparency

Customers want to have real-time visibility of shipping and last-mile delivery. They require to know when the driver would arrive exactly.

That's why a last-mile delivery logistics solution needs to be more transparent and keep the customers aware of their moving transport.

Apart from being very curious, people don’t get easily pleased. That’s why tracking codes are not enough anymore.

Today, users want absolute real-time visibility**.** Which means they want to see where their order is in the last mile as it moves across it.

Even if the delivery is on the same day, they still want to receive a more accurate [**estimated time of the arrival**](https://elogii.com/blog/estimated-time-of-arrival-eta/) of their package.

### #5 Address Location and Delivery Allocation

Factors such as an inaccurate address, locating the place, no parking availability, customers that want to return a product, and many other issues change the cost and time.

In fact, most failed deliveries are caused by wrong addresses.

To understand the severity of the problem, you should know that [**the cost of a failed delivery can be as much as $16.58**](https://postandparcel.info/93399/news/e-commerce/true-cost-implications-failed-deliveries/).

Hence, it’s not unusual that in most cases, the incorrect address is a serious problem.

Besides that, there is a problem with brands and companies that [**still manually plan deliveries**](https://elogii.com/blog/are-you-still-planning-manually/), which naturally leaves room for human error.

The new business model is focused on the fast delivery of both products and services.

### #6 Efficiency

The new business model is centered on the fast delivery of both products and services.

To achieve that, you need increased efficiency, which sadly isn’t the easiest thing to do.

Here, technology plays a key role. It helps you to keep up with consumer demands.

Last-mile delivery logistics technologies such as delivery software allow you to streamline operations from the first mile of delivery to the customer’s door.

This means you can cover every step of first-mile and last-mile delivery.

Last-mile delivery logistics software plays the main role in making last-mile delivery more efficient.

### #7 Last-Mile Delivery Density

For last-mile delivery logistics to be efficient, there has to be sufficient delivery density.

Routes have to have as many stops as possible to minimize transportation between them, which helps cut the cost of delivery.

But as more companies deliver products in cities like London or New York that also means that there is a lot of competition.

So even if you deliver goods in major urban centers, manually planning routes for vehicles may still lead to lower stop density.

Again, that can have a serious impact on efficiency, as well as the cost of your operation.

Luckily, there is a solution for all of the [**last-mile delivery challenges**](https://elogii.com/blog/last-mile-delivery-challenges/):
