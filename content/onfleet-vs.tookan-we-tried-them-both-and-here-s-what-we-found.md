## Onfleet vs. Tookan – Ease of use

### Onfleet

Onfleet has a well-designed and easy-to-use interface.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vhGljzhZudMTAtrTpnazuC96tWLZYv1qszwzQJOy1NxRtUT0XcRJDxDxIOKWMtrzAJ1e9-fVyE9cblXAJzDQ6KmoKGhQhdZmVBbIj68HIM_04Z3a64Wr4EGdxzqNppeS0Ok8YKE7X_X30DBpkETWYC0ivvYrC80SXVosyxGljNDPcSE_yk_n1Mb7j15btg =624x359)

Onfleet – UI

The driver app is fantastic – it takes just a few minutes to onboard new drivers. The clear and straightforward layout also makes the software accessible for those who aren't tech-savvy. The drag-and-drop features are also amazing and time-saving.

Onfleet, however, doesn’t have the capabilities to implement more sophisticated forms of delivery optimization, such as the allocation of loads based on vehicle types and capacities or the ability to pair tasks with the most qualified drivers.

Another downside of Onfleet is the occasional bugs and app freezes. These have been the [subject of many customer complaints](https://www.g2.com/products/onfleet/reviews/onfleet-review-5186918).

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3fYW6SAPhgv5Oari_fYTjPHoJs5Bjmjo6zGJsUwTzmbAW4ZiCB-cd5aF2zETMrN7R6PKei9HARAdM2drXY6W4ObrexDYGpQC4g-oELz3d7EiNHLAttdKiHqNoSM2mQcay5jFWuq9wbwSOaRtIwXgE1SZNAzEHfc4TEwaB32s45n6TlBEUX-4ElKZsOPqxg =624x452)

Onfleet - A review about glitches and bugs

One of Onfleet's customers also mentioned in a review that the software's navigation features were sometimes lacking. For instance, when a driver initiated a job and clicked "navigate," the software simply displayed the destination's coordinates, not the actual address.

Another user mentioned that Onfleet sometimes directs drivers to take routes that would “require amphibious delivery vehicles.”

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FSbkkJnBr9z2pQaYRjH620PrQRdhymNmA94hPpTDcWqoOyci_L1QZwA5-c1DxPcafFeJj65c9LQhy1-tFdwWyr_McP4Ka_Q_NR8R8BFwheHdVVmE3z4POPg2y_iWmYmFIl_OfQFAmb70FWLkcpLmznbF4hQJ54Y2C77MTF9Wov7BBzQZL8aKPOFhQmXK7Q =624x408)

Onfleet – A review about the navigation features

### Tookan

Tookan is relatively easy to use and has a feature set that is highly customizable and adaptable across a wide range of use cases.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JI2q9kbpJj4184gMn38d3MxPP0wn5mMpsJlGSOlFnADL3pBhucWDe9uBOTOJlVd9frBIKiVKnyvU6ze_cOt5U5CbTK0EfvkDhT5STBwgLgKPGdHeXkekwShFZ2LxrjUjgvdB-Ixm5s6frLom5Z0qGkeIqLsLKXbtnF40rpk7op09YnEFTtdprTl-Di3j4Q =624x257)

Tookan – UI

Everything from the user interface to the menus to the batch upload to the drag-and-drop functionality of the stops makes Tookan a breeze to use.

The software's administrative/dispatch and driver interfaces are intuitive and user-friendly. It has role-based access, allowing admins to form teams based on specific tasks.

However, one of Tookan's users spoke [negatively of the service's excessive downtime](https://www.capterra.com/p/218952/Tookan/reviews/). According to him, the app crashes at least once a week, preventing his clients from making orders (something that has a negative impact on his revenue).

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6XJ9FXQPEtYZ2hlaB6uo0m_w9UBSPdhflxpjJIxYjPIrYKQles5Ipo5DQootRA8hPmcXQeg5aTaOSFShQvCuqlPcEPguWpE7OHbipPs73_-9o87gPtBWCmA1TMcNr83tmCCmM7-8OxvyQG2QJGlIt9veEXnum0s82Zg00Z5o446n5LXUtS_bO6t58OAr4Q =624x351)

Tookan – A review about downtime

Another [client complained](https://www.capterra.com/p/218952/Tookan/reviews/) about how difficult it was to utilize the server because of connectivity problems and glitches, especially when trying to upload multiple files at once.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lNBIs9M6Ep35w0DZMgJ0ElMqp7gejcwzhL0IeRtDgZUdDq_cM5RqVOXW8-X9VWYuDi81H6Elh74vYielqq0P6TZ7euKJ58nr6Uy8kj2uRB2nhQm7E8BeD9DZDgEXjo_gE5MjvUQwbnP7mfB0eCkEuS3E2iEuDFF83npd1GmuTc7cqpVkWRuvQoSBK0WcIw =624x244)

Tookan – A review about uploading multiple files

### The verdict

Onfleet and Tookan have great interfaces and are relatively easy to use.

However, both tools are plagued with glitches, sudden freezes, and connectivity issues, leading to a poor customer experience and a loss of orders.

## Onfleet vs. Tookan – Key features

### Onfleet

[Onfleet](https://elogii.com/blog/onfleet-reviews/) has the following features:

* **Route optimization –** You can improve your delivery times by updating the route for your drivers directly from your dispatch center (though this feature is reserved for the more expensive Onfleet plans). Route optimization can also help you navigate traffic, poor weather, and construction zones.

* **Collection of Proof of Delivery (POD)** – Onfleet aids in ensuring POD accuracy by recording customer signatures, barcodes, pictures, etc. However, you won't be able to scan barcodes on a basic plan – you’ll need to upgrade to a higher subscription.

* **Driver analytics –** With analytics, you can conduct real-time tracking and identify which drivers are the most productive and which are the least productive.

* **Real-time driver location tracking** – Customers can check the status of their orders and find out where their drivers are at any given time.

* **Customer feedback feature –** Customers can submit detailed feedback on the service they received once their order has been received. You can also use Onfleet’s comprehensive reports and data to analyze this feedback.

* **Predictive ETAs –** This feature keeps users up to date on the expected delivery time of their order. However, this function isn't included in the starter tier (the best option for small businesses and startups). Only the more expensive packages include ETAs.

### Tookan

Tookan has the following key features:

* **Live driver tracking –** Monitor your fleet and drivers in real time with a map-based dashboard.

* **Route optimization –** The app shares optimized routes and specific directions to facilitate fast deliveries.

* **Delivery confirmation –** Drivers can confirm deliveries in a few different ways, including by scanning a barcode, getting a signature from the recipient, and uploading an image.

* **SMS and email alerts –** You can use Bumblr or third-party apps to send and receive SMS messages. You can also notify customers by email to keep them up to date on the status of their orders.

* **Predictive ETAs –** Tookan’s all-inclusive dashboard makes it simple to monitor your fleets' locations live. It also gives you precise ETA estimations with modifications for delays.

* **Customizable user permissions –** You can assign specialized tasks to managers, drivers, and dispatchers. You can also manage who has access to what to ensure that everyone on the team has what they need to do their jobs.

* **White-label options –** At any tier of Tookan’s subscription service, customers can pay a small fee to change Tookan's branding for their own company logos.

* **Appointment scheduling –** Appointment service requests can be handled by Tookan’s specialized scheduling software. The app features two-way SMS texting so you can contact customers who have scheduled appointments with you and go over any questions they may have.

### The verdict

Onfleet and Tookan both provide a lot of valuable features.

However, the lack of predicted ETA functionality really annoys many businesses who sign up for Tookan's starting plans. One consumer even complained that this causes too many unsuccessful deliveries and that the live tracking feature isn't beneficial to customers.

Tookan's elimination of its integration with Google Maps was also cited as a problem by several consumers.

So, Onfleet has better features.

## Onfleet vs. Tookan – Integrations and API

### Onfleet

Onfleet integrates with a wide range of third-party systems. These include Slack, Salesforce, Google Sheets, Google Maps, Zapier, and many eCommerce platforms.

However, there is currently no direct API key for Shopify or Stripe, meaning orders must be routed through Zapier before they can reach Onfleet.

### Tookan

Tookan integrates with many third-party apps, eCommerce platforms, and POS restaurant systems. It has 80+ third-party system integrations, including GrubHub, Square, Eat24, Shopify, and Stripe.

Tookan provides an open API for advanced integration needs, and Zapier offers dozens of pre-built connectors businesses can use for Tookan.

### The verdict

Onfleet and Tookan both have many useful integrations.

However, when compared to Onfleet, Tookan has more app integrations.

Tookan wins.

## Onfleet vs. Tookan – Pricing

### Onfleet

Onfleet offers three pricing tiers, as shown below:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uetViPFttf7IrcXvcy3-Znk608H_Rr4SXOeZmj8lM8RUu6tUiXCM7lkda9NQPQq_05sel9FDfRpS3l89GcaJL_cwFuSs0D8Keh6YTxEG6QW6v2R9dsAIu38lO1VACcOSTj1DMP8md1mGgi6Es7fwKAH-6ZlShBSbOh_wELLnEybV9mCVz2ucmPye_Bg7rA =624x343)

Onfleet – Pricing

Onfleet's flat pricing structure can be too expensive over the long run for businesses with a small number of delivery vehicles. For instance, it's not cost-effective if you pay $1150 monthly to manage three drivers.

There is also a one-year contract obligation, so if Onfleet doesn’t fulfill your needs, you may need to stick with Onfleet until your plan expires.

### Tookan

Tookan offers its software to businesses at four different subscription levels – Early Stage, Startup, Growth, and Standard.

It also provides a fifth level – Enterprise – on a case-by-case basis with custom pricing.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wqr04aOWkbt0NhEieMwG-SKcXiRoWr8lSWuaKKTfkgOwBQpdq8JmmL-_tKMTdHBAxLXQr5V2oC8V205Vq_lbwFtfcqyy-PmeJMsajyXXG65pqMO-PkReOQJOw4sQRmSkvBdQ65adjXdWaonnYYY3Yqf2AX4wpfR7mY_WQ2cfq5qOchWgtDEDpcf5HMLe_g =624x251)

Tookan – Pricing

All tiers of membership grant access to the API, an unlimited number of drivers, and 24/7 customer support. However, the quantity of monthly jobs and online order forms varies according to your membership level.

Tookan offers a free trial for 14 days.

### The verdict

Onfleet’s pricing structure is ideal for large fleets with many drivers. Onfleet’s expensive plans aren't cost-effective for companies with only three or four drivers.

If you go with a cheaper Onfleet package, you might get average service that won't leave a good impression on your customers. There are significant restrictions on cheaper plans, including the absence of a barcode scanner from the Starter plan.

While Tookan's base pricing is reasonable, the cost of using Tookan’s more advanced, pricey features can quickly add up. If you want to take advantage of most/all of Tookan's features, then it won’t be the cheap delivery option you might want.

Additionally, ETAs are not included in the base plan, so you'll need to spring for a more expensive bundle right from the jump if you want to use them.

## Onfleet vs. Tookan – Use cases

### Onfleet

Onfleet assists a wide variety of businesses with their last-mile product deliveries. It can accommodate major firms and smaller operations wishing to expand into local deliveries.

When employed by companies with many drivers handling a significant monthly order volume, Onfleet becomes a cost-effective choice. With Onfleet's flat-rate pricing tier, your cost per driver drops as your fleet size increases.

### Tookan

Tookan is a wonderful option for small businesses due to its low price and integrations with many restaurant POS systems.

Tookan's compatibility with a wide range of eCommerce platforms and POS solutions makes it a good choice for breweries, supermarkets, and restaurants as well.

### The verdict

Tookan's features and pricing structure make it a great fit for fledgling businesses that don't yet have a lot of capital but would benefit from a delivery management system.

Onfleet is suitable for large businesses with big fleets and simple needs.

And if your company is larger, has more sophisticated routing requirements, and requires an all-encompassing platform, consider eLogii.

## Onfleet vs. Tookan – Customer service and training

### Onfleet

In the event of an urgent situation, Onfleet's absence of live technical support can be inconvenient and detrimental to your business.

Email is Onfleet’s only method of contact, but this is a challenging option because you have to wait for a response.

However, Onfleet allows you to arrange a specific amount of support calls each month instead of receiving live phone help, depending on your plan. The team also hosts webinars and in-person training sessions occasionally.

### Tookan

Tookan’s customer service is excellent. Whenever you need help, you can start a live chat session with a rep and get a quick response.

Tookan also offers an FAQ database where you can quickly search for answers. You can also find comprehensive product demonstrations on the Jungleworks YouTube channel.

The Tookan team also frequently hosts training webinars to share information and improve the skill sets of users.

### The verdict

When compared to Onfleet, Tookan's customer service is far more efficient and comprehensive.

## Onfleet vs. Tookan – Analytics and reporting

### Onfleet

Onfleet delivers beneficial data for both drivers and administrators/dispatchers.

As a result, drivers may quickly and conveniently look back on their work history and learn things like:

* The breakdown of their service time, travel time, and task durations
* Whether their past deliveries were on time or delayed
* The number of miles they traveled
* Both the distance and the length of time spent on duty (including how long they spent in transit and idle)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cZUkEVzbPGi9ZgxzjhcJ7LejVsoNFdXSkBpQkM8h9_QLzKTkb4BMpgDVIQ0dd_UQbb3zPJLZ8KLcsIlchHMsQp5QFFN2vdIPV7k7UlQSSCZK4v6aqsWEOhG6ejLwynd-gJ6btFzk3L3uVGneYYwEQxldRKKbYvaazzaszKh95IeI-ICjtr2AgCNfdz2Wbg =624x355)

Onfleet – Reporting

With Onfleet, you can also see where all of your vehicles are at all times and get information on how productive each driver is. These metrics will give you a continuous, high-level snapshot of your drivers' activity.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_spjhKwem0i0wX2QfejNY5VAY17Nvuojyh8Fs6zEGSoFvyPy3dHCep2LxC05g46g_zQIOVs1hpxmoGsArDOm14vmxSe0-nT0nBsJg_91MY4lJe3OCr14Hj7PeOQ7vX6pMMLszonZMqAvG-HLSpBvKel4JM1VvYzM-6ufKL1x64x2KNl9Mdn5BlChnO-lvA =205x326)

Onfleet – In-app reports

### Tookan

Tookan allows fleet managers to keep up with their fleet through reports produced by geo-analytics.

Tookan also provides a delivery operation KPI dashboard. This dashboard shows indicators such as time and distance-based productivity, real-time driver status, and delivery status.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LHn1O0FQnSdiYWQp8oHgBYDxHVLPESXxOlJl2eajhNzShdPZRMoWVRgwHfXjphK7fxSO6JY6-KQIxRZjy89PS2kgEhUuv_V__a_xSa3IcJO1Rn3WTJeog3XyxKTeiP1bvv4C1T2YHUDIVPFXPp04JpoP9r8x2IlcDHmnrHOrsMuD2mH_xIs7rMyE4LjBTQ =624x372)

Tookan – Delivery dashboard

Driver records are archived for 90 days and can be retrieved if necessary.

Data can be viewed as a dynamic chart or sorted and presented in a list. You can also apply filters to the report based on the driving team or time period selected.

### The verdict

Onfleet and Tookan have great analytics and reporting capabilities. However, Onfleet lacks geo-analytics features.

Tookan wins.

## Onfleet vs. Tookan. vs. eLogii

There are many substantial challenges to effective delivery systems, and a failure to optimize in this area can increase inventory and shipping costs.

It is possible, however, to boost customer satisfaction while reducing costs through strategic investments in delivery management processes and technologies.

Tookan and Onfleet are excellent options for managing deliveries, but they have drawbacks.

If your business is small and has modest needs, then Tookan may be a good fit.

Onfleet, on the other hand, is flexible enough to meet the needs of a mid-sized company, but the platform's main capabilities are locked behind the more expensive tiers. Onfleet's higher plans are also pricey and might not be viable options for a small business.

We should also note that Onfleet and Tookan's software both have issues related to software hiccups and freezes, which can halt deliveries.

Therefore, eLogii may be the best option for enterprises with higher standards, as it offers a robust and complete delivery management solution.

eLogii is a one-stop shop for delivery management and optimization. It empowers its users to meet the many demands of today's transportation and delivery logistics jobs.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EYSeG5Tz0GFdOU0TLDww5VykoRfHwSzQO6KVRg2YuYJVjuUwmnajtURddiprt_Ho4e9mTJg8HloQTB_a5cvl4D2bODwaUeOfV6pfxT0OmR3XcJtDAc-9CnTeKtwE7xQUk5qgd-mHQ_V_RNTqv4_sg49D2lvugbe5vo5KC7xpYKB5fCAdN_5enKmzZYsSgQ =624x353)

eLogii's features and scalability make it the best delivery management solution for organizations of any size. The adaptable design also allows it to serve various industries, from field service providers to merchants.

Delivery optimization strategies like load planning according to vehicle type and capacity and pairing difficult assignments with the most qualified drivers are not available on Onfleet and Tookan – but these features are available on eLogii.

Another great feature is that all [eLogii plans](https://elogii.com/plans-and-features?utm_content=Cj0KCQjwidSWBhDdARIsAIoTVb3rzMUA0BtUIPyXleIaPk7ODhqHDEWXrpWW_HCGKoi2omXmaU7DErUaAuT1EALw_wcB) can accommodate unlimited users, drivers, and vehicles, making them perfect for expanding businesses.
