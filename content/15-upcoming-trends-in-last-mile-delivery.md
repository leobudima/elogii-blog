Today, we take a look at the future. And the fifteen upcoming trends in last-mile delivery.

We've all witnessed the madness of 2020. For better or worse, there's no denying that a lot of things have changed.

Combine it with the tectonic shifts that were already happening, and the age of disruption is truly here.

Yes, it's terrifying. But it's also exciting.

The arriving tide is redefining the last mile. And that's the only sure thing about the future of last-mile delivery.

But there are hints at what might happen. So, it's worth taking a second to explore them. And get a better understanding of the last-mile delivery trends that will take place in the next couple of years.

Let's dive right in.

## What is a last-mile delivery?

As the name implies, **last-mile delivery** is the final stage in the fulfilment process. It's the transportation of a purchase from a store or supply chain hub to the customer's home or office address.

And while the term is new, the concept isn't. (In case you were wondering when did last-mile delivery become popular)

But these days it's on everyone's mind. And for a good reason.

[**The state of delivery in time of the coronavirus**](https://elogii.com/blog/the-state-of-delivery-in-time-of-the-coronavirus/ "the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus") had turned things on its head. Add to that the growing popularity of eCommerce and online retail, and the significance of last-mile delivery logistics is unparalleled.

So, what's going on?

## How is last-mile delivery changing?

In the last ten years, a lot of changes happened in last-mile delivery. And this year, things went into overdrive.

It's hard to single out all of them. But we chose three disruptors that we believe are causing these changes:

* The adoption of technology
* Changing consumer trends
* The COVID-19 pandemic

And it's worth taking a closer look at all three to get a better feel for the current landscape.

### Technology and last-mile delivery

Like in all other facets of business, technology is a critical disruptor in last-mile delivery, as well.

From online shopping and eCommerce to cloud computing, AI and [**IoT**](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/insights/internet-of-things), technology has changed delivery both inside and outside of the business.

On the one hand, the internet, smartphones, and apps had changed the way people shop. And what they expect from your business. (But more on that later)

On the other hand, technology like delivery management software has reshaped how companies organize the last mile.

For starters, many are [**adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics**](https://elogii.com/blog/adopting-the-cloud-first-approach-to-delivery-logistics/ "adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics"). A surge of SaaS solutions has made it easier to manage operations across the entire supply chain.

From how teams communicate to how drivers collect [**proof of delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/electronic-proof-of-delivery-epod-how-does-it-improve-logistics-operations/ "digital proof of delivery"), and more, these systems are automating the entire delivery process.

At the same time, emerging technologies are starting to appear. For example, some companies are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to collect customer data.

But if you take a look at the [**Gartner Hype Cycle**](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-08-18-gartner-identifies-five-emerging-trends-that-will-drive-technology-innovation-for-the-next-decade), we're still a long way away from a productive adoption of AI:

Still, this isn't stopping companies from using new tech stacks in their day-to-day activities. Nor will it stop the changes brought on by technology.

### Consumer trends of last-mile delivery

In the last few years, what consumers expect from delivery had also changed.

Thanks to technology, more people shop online than ever before. In fact, right now, [**one in five products are sold online**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/534123/e-commerce-share-of-retail-sales-worldwide/). And that's almost three times more than just five years ago:

![](/blog/uploads/e-commerce-share-of-total-retail-sales.jpg)

So, [**customers want convenience**](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey.html) when they shop.

But that means delivery is no longer an option for companies. A business in 2020 that has an online store has to have a last-mile delivery set up to support it.

All you have to do is take a look at Amazon and other retail giants to see the success of eCommerce and on-demand home delivery.

But even that is no longer enough. Customers also want to choose how you deliver their orders.

Thanks to Amazon, consumers want more options when it comes to the speed and cost of delivery.

Customers don't want to wait a week to receive their purchase. They want it to get it as soon as possible, and at no cost to them.

So, if you want to know [**how to compete with Amazon delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-amazon-delivery/ "how to compete with Amazon delivery"), you'll have to start thinking about these new consumer trends.

### COVID-19 and last-mile delivery

If technology and consumer trends were the gasoline that fueled changes in the last mile over the past decade, COVID-19 was the spark that finally set them ablaze.

We saw how in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic life at home, and at work, had to change overnight.

[**The Next Normal**](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/the-next-normal) demands from consumers and businesses to transform. And that means delivery is no longer about choice. It's the key to adapt and survive.

People who'd never before done their shopping online started buying everything from groceries to medicines and clothes over their phones and computers.

Businesses that refused to offer home delivery and open up an e-store on their website did it without hesitation.

But, at the same time, companies that offered these things were prepared for the high intake of business in a world that relies on almost solely on delivery (be it B2C or B2B).

These businesses too had to adopt technology and cater to the new consumer to keep up with the high expectations and demand. They learned that you have to [**improve the last-mile delivery when demand exceeds your capacity**](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-improve-last-mile-delivery-when-demand-exceeds-your-capacity/ "how to improve last-mile delivery when demand exceeds your capacity").

So, the pressure to change is real. And companies are scrambling to transform. (Both in terms of how they do business and how they see their customers)

But that means it's not over yet. And although the future is still unclear, there is evidence about what it might bring. So, let's take a look.

## Upcoming trends in last-mile delivery

When it comes to last-mile delivery, it's clear that technology and consumer expectations will be the driving force of its transformation.

But what are these changes? And how will they affect the last mile?

To find out, we've put together a list of the fifteen trends in last-mile delivery that will happen in the next decade.

Of course, this isn't concrete. But it can give you a glimpse of the future, and how last-mile delivery innovations can help you to overcome all of the challenges brought upon by this change.

Let's jump in.

### 1. Even faster order fulfilment

Faster fulfilment isn't anything new. Delivery is always speeding up. And customers will continue to want their orders to arrive as soon as possible.

Ten years ago, people were willing to wait on average 5-7 days for an order to arrive. Jump to 2020, and the standard delivery is now [**two days**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/561768/fast-online-order-delivery-us-consumers/).

The same thing may happen with one-day delivery.

In fact, [**same-day delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/same-day-delivery-and-delivery-management-software/ "same-day delivery and delivery management software") is already here. Albeit you either have to pay for it, or meet specific criteria.

At the moment, Amazon is spearheading the revolution. In 2019, the company rolled out its [**free one-day delivery for Prime members**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/03/amazon-starts-to-roll-out-free-one-day-delivery-for-prime-members.html).

Even though we're still a long way away from widespread adoption, it will become a reality at one point thanks to technology. (Which will make it more affordable and easier to manage the supply chain)

### 2. Local in-house delivery

Local SMBs were at the biggest risk in 2020. But also the greatest risk-takers.

By adapting to survive and adding local delivery to their list of services, local businesses have tapped into the most efficient way of delivering goods and services to local consumers. And customers had greeted the decision with opened arms.

The success of local delivery comes from three things: rapid fulfilment, low cost, and intimate knowledge of the local last-mile.

That has meant the returns were quick, while the risk was zero since the chance of a failed delivery is almost impossible.

The next step for SMBs is to [**plan multi-depot locations**](https://elogii.com/blog/planning-at-depot-level-vs-multi-depot-planning/ "single vs. multi-depot planning") around their brick-and-mortar presence and treat their stores as warehouses.

That allows you to create both an online and offline offer, which can lead to even more profit.

### Insourcing deliveries

Thanks to the demand for last-mile delivery and affordable SaaS solutions for managing it, insourcing delivery operations is easier than ever.

In 2020, we've seen more and more companies move away from 3PL and delivery providers.

Instead of outsourcing their last-mile delivery operations, many retailers have decided to handle things internally.

Most rely on a small internal fleet or offload part of their operation to an outside source (a hybrid fleet).

With the promise of 100% control over operations, prices, and costs, it makes a lot of sense for many businesses to own their own fleet.

And even though outsourcing continues to be the order of the day, we predict that this trend will change in the future.

### Hybrid fleet management

As mentioned above, some businesses are moving towards a hybrid fleet model to handle their last-mile delivery operations.

A hybrid fleet is a mix of an internal fleet and teams, and outside contractors, freelance drivers, and 3PL providers.

Compared to other strategies, the hybrid model is more flexible and affordable. But it's also necessary for some situations.

For example, when demand for delivery exceeds the capacity of an internal fleet, many companies resort to this delivery tactic to grow their operation quickly to scale. But it's benefits go beyond that.

If you align your strategy with your fleet operator, you can create more possibilities and generate extra value from the synergy within your supply chain.
