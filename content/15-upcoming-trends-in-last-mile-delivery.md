Today, we take a look at the future. And the fifteen upcoming trends in last-mile delivery.

We've all witnessed the madness of 2020. For better or worse, there's no denying that a lot of things have changed.

Combine it with the tectonic shifts that were already happening, and the age of disruption is truly here.

Yes, it's terrifying. But it's also exciting.

The arriving tide is redefining the last mile. And that's the only sure thing about the future of last-mile delivery.

But there are hints at what might happen. So, it's worth taking a second to explore them. And get a better understanding of the last-mile delivery trends that will take place in the next couple of years.

Let's dive right in.

## What is a last-mile delivery?

As the name implies, **last-mile delivery** is the final stage in the fulfilment process. It's the transportation of a purchase from a store or supply chain hub to the customer's home or office address.

And while the term is new, the concept isn't. (In case you were wondering when did last-mile delivery become popular)

But these days it's on everyone's mind. And for a good reason.

[**The state of delivery in time of the coronavirus**](https://elogii.com/blog/the-state-of-delivery-in-time-of-the-coronavirus/ "the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus") had turned things on its head. Add to that the growing popularity of eCommerce and online retail, and the significance of last-mile delivery logistics is unparalleled.

So, what's going on?

## How is last-mile delivery changing?

In the last ten years, a lot of changes happened in last-mile delivery. And this year, things went into overdrive.

It's hard to single out all of them. But we chose three disruptors that we believe are causing these changes:

* The adoption of technology
* Changing consumer trends
* The COVID-19 pandemic

And it's worth taking a closer look at all three to get a better feel for the current landscape.

### Technology and last-mile delivery

Like in all other facets of business, technology is a critical disruptor in last-mile delivery, as well.

From online shopping and eCommerce to cloud computing, AI and [**IoT**](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/insights/internet-of-things), technology has changed delivery both inside and outside of the business.

On the one hand, the internet, smartphones, and apps had changed the way people shop. And what they expect from your business. (But more on that later)

On the other hand, technology like delivery management software has reshaped how companies organize the last mile.

For starters, many are [**adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics**](https://elogii.com/blog/adopting-the-cloud-first-approach-to-delivery-logistics/ "adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics"). A surge of SaaS solutions has made it easier to manage operations across the entire supply chain.

From how teams communicate to how drivers collect [**proof of delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/electronic-proof-of-delivery-epod-how-does-it-improve-logistics-operations/ "digital proof of delivery"), and more, these systems are automating the entire delivery process.

At the same time, emerging technologies are starting to appear. For example, some companies are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to collect customer data.

But if you take a look at the [**Gartner Hype Cycle**](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-08-18-gartner-identifies-five-emerging-trends-that-will-drive-technology-innovation-for-the-next-decade), we're still a long way away from a productive adoption of AI:

Still, this isn't stopping companies from using new tech stacks in their day-to-day activities. Nor will it stop the changes brought on by technology.

### Consumer trends of last-mile delivery

In the last few years, what consumers expect from delivery had also changed.

Thanks to technology, more people shop online than ever before. In fact, right now, [**one in five products are sold online**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/534123/e-commerce-share-of-retail-sales-worldwide/). And that's almost three times more than just five years ago:

So, [**customers want convenience**](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey.html) when they shop.

But that means delivery is no longer an option for companies. A business in 2020 that has an online store has to have a last-mile delivery set up to support it.

All you have to do is take a look at Amazon and other retail giants to see the success of eCommerce and on-demand home delivery.

But even that is no longer enough. Customers also want to choose how you deliver their orders.

Thanks to Amazon, consumers want more options when it comes to the speed and cost of delivery.

Customers don't want to wait a week to receive their purchase. They want it to get it as soon as possible, and at no cost to them.

So, if you want to know [**how to compete with Amazon delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-amazon-delivery/ "how to compete with Amazon delivery"), you'll have to start thinking about these new consumer trends.
