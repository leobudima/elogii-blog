# Dynamic Route Planning vs Static Route Planning: What to Use in 2023?




Learn about the difference between static and dynamic route planning and how using software that supports both is the best way to plan and optimize routes.




In this article, we explain the difference between static and dynamic routing.




And why you should use each of these route planning methods to optimize your operations.




Not to mention how using software that’s capable of both static and dynamic routing greatly improves efficiency.




Let’s get started.

## Introducing: Dynamic Route Planning

Dynamic route planning is a new way to [plan better routes](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-plan-better-delivery-routes/).




It doesn’t aim to replace typical route planning.




Instead it gives you the opportunity to do it in real time.




Which means you can go into greater detail with how you plan and manage operations.




All in turn put even more effort into how you maximize efficiency.




Simply put:




It enables you to save even more time, money, and energy.




How?




Here’s everything you need to know:




## What Is Dynamic Route Planning?

Dynamic route planning is a process of creating or adjusting live routes to generate completely new routes for drivers while they’re already on the road completing tasks. 




In other words: 




With dynamic routing, you can plan a new route and dispatch it to a driver in real time. Or adjust an existing route by changing its stop order or by adding new stops to it to dynamically alter it. 




The goal is to meet new and incoming operational demands without sacrificing route efficiency.




## How Does Dynamic Routing Work?

Dynamic route planning is a live operation. (Like [dispatching](https://elogii.com/blog/fleet-dispatching/) or [collecting proof of delivery](https://elogii.com/blog/proof-of-delivery/).)




To work, drivers have to have already set off on their routes. And you use dynamic routing to adjust their route or change it completely by creating a new one.




In theory, it is possible to do manual dynamic routing. 




For example, you can change a driver’s stop order, their next stop location, or add a new stop to their route. 




But this requires drivers to physically input the new data into their [schedules](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-plan-better-delivery-schedules/). Or dispatchers have to navigate the driver via call to ensure route efficiency.




And that means you’re not able to do it for more than one stop at a time. Or on a large scale.




That’s why it works best with dynamic route planning software.




With automated route planning you can:




* Plan new routes and assign them live
* Add new tasks (stops) to a live route
* Change the stop order of a live route
* Re-optimize live routes




And you can do this for multiple routes and drivers.




Let’s see how this works with eLogii:




\#1 Planning new routes live

Instead of selecting a future date on your planning screen, you select the current date (Today):

![choosing-current-date](/blog/uploads/choosing-current-date.png "choosing-current-date")


You then create a new route based on the imported tasks:


![dynamic-route](/blog/uploads/construction-delivery-route-planning-with-elogii.jpg "dynamic-route")

Then, all you have to do is select the intended driver and swap the existing route with the one you’ve just created:


![swapping-route](/blog/uploads/swapping-route.png "swapping-route")

Once that is done, the new route is instantly uploaded to the driver app:

![synching-route-with-driver-app](/blog/uploads/synching-route-with-driver-app.png "synching-route-with-driver-app")


The driver is notified about the change and can continue to complete tasks along the new route. So there is no need for manual dispatching.




\#2 Adding new stops to a live route

To add a new stop to a live route, all you have to do is create or select a task that you want to add to the route:

![planning-new-route-live-task](/blog/uploads/planning-new-route-live-task.png "planning-new-route-live-task")


And then assign it to the driver:

![assigning-task](/blog/uploads/assigning-task.png "assigning-task")


Once you’ve done that all you have to do is click Re-optimize:

![re-optimize-route](/blog/uploads/re-optimize-route.png "re-optimize-route")


eLogii will re-adjust the route to account for the new stop and sync it with the driver app automatically:

![synching-route-with-driver-app](/blog/uploads/synching-route-with-driver-app.png "synching-route-with-driver-app")


\#3 Changing the stop order of a live route

To change the stop order of a live route with eLogii, you can use the drag-and-drop feature.




All you have to do is drag and drop an incomplete task (ones still available) to the position in the order in which you want them completed:

![re-ordering-tasks-stop-order](/blog/uploads/re-ordering-tasks-stop-order.png "re-ordering-tasks-stop-order")


Once that’s done, you need to click the Reoptimize button to complete the action.

![](/blog/uploads/re-optimize-button.png)


And the software will change the stop order of the route and sync it with the driver app.




\#4 Re-optimizing live routes 

With eLogii, you can re-optimize existing routes in real-time. To do this, all you need to do is select a route and click Re-optimize from the drop-down menu:

![re-optimizing-route](/blog/uploads/re-optimizing-route.png "re-optimizing-route")


The software will automatically make adjustments to the route to factor in, for example traffic or drop-off delays, to ensure maximum route efficiency.




And again, once the route is re-optimized and generated, it is synced with the driver app.




## Example of Dynamic Routing

There are numerous examples of dynamic route planning.




In fact, dynamic routing is used by many different companies in a variety of industries. From delivery and distribution to [last-mile carriers](https://elogii.com/blog/last-mile-carrier/).




But probably the best example is USPS.




USPS has been sorting millions of packages for over ten years with [dynamic deliveries](https://link.usps.com/2015/11/18/dynamic-deliveries/).




The nationwide Postal Service has over 2,000 of its facilities using dynamic routing ever since introducing it in 2013.




The results they’ve seen are promising: in just two years, they sorted 107 million packages and created 1.4 million routes.




Their key dynamic routing concept rests on two things:




* Sorting delivery points in the most logical order
* Providing turn-by-turn driving instructions for letter carriers




The Postal Service implemented this method as part of a bigger plan to grow its package service. One of the main goals was to expand their Sunday delivery capacities.




Dynamic routing helped achieve that goal.




## Pros and Cons of Dynamic Route Planning

Using dynamic route optimization software comes with a lot of advantages.




While it helps create efficient routes, there are a few things you should pay attention to.




Here are some key pros and cons of dynamic routing.




### Pros of Dynamic Routing

* Reduction of Costs

Using the right last mile routing software reduces fuel consumption.




Your drivers spend less time going from one stop to the next.




That reduces the gas you use, and puts less mileage on the vehicle.




That means less cost on vehicle maintenance.




As dynamic routing helps achieve faster and more accurate deliveries, you will find yourself spending less on mending broken customer relationships.




* Saving Time

As we’ve said, your drivers will spend less time on inefficient routes.




Dynamic route software gives you the fastest and most efficient route.




And even give you time to fulfill more orders!




Moreover, as they will spend less time on static route planning, dispatchers and fleet managers will save time and redirect their focus on expanding your business!




* Allowing for Accurate Estimated Time of Arrival ETA

The real-time data dynamic routing software gives you precise ETAs the software can share with customers.




That means no more wide delivery windows that will keep people waiting nervously at home for their orders.




The ETAs are updated in real-time by the system.




That way everyone stays in the loop and the late delivery rate lowers.




* Higher Customer Satisfaction

Dynamic routing minimizes delivery disruptions.




It bounces back quickly after obstacles come up and updates the information to drivers and the customers.




That way big delays are avoided and customers are held in the loop.




* Taking Care of Priority Orders

Software for route planning lets you squeeze priority orders in without messing up the rest of the route.




The drivers simply get an updated route once you adjust it through the “Reoptimize” option.




### Cons of Dynamic Routing

* Difficult Without Software

If you’re not equipped with the right technology, you won’t be able to perform dynamic routing.




It’s too complex to do manually.




There are too many parameters to consider and problems to solve if a change happens in a route.




* It Doesn’t Come Cheap

The complexity and quality of dynamic routing come with a price.




If you have a business that takes care of more than a few orders, chances are, using Google Maps for free just won’t cut it.




But that’s where eLogii’s comes in.




You can check out our [personalized pricing plan](https://elogii.com/pricing?utm_content=CjwKCAjw_YShBhAiEiwAMomsEP2B8BXMB_ER9ryWG4zLcSra2ogGNtf2GI3fBbCyuj_dFZgJF_YJmRoC9JAQAvD_BwE) for more information.




* Obstacles in Loading Vehicles

Well, some may view this as an obstacle. Others may not.




The thing is, when you rely on dynamic routes, you can’t fill your fleet’s vehicles right in the morning.




Instead, you wait for route planners to finalize the delivery schedule through the software.




## Static Route Planning Still Works GREAT!

Traditional, or static route planning still has a role to play in how you plan your operations.




In fact, it remains the main way to:




* Avoid [using Google Maps to plan routes

  ](https://elogii.com/blog/route-planning-google-maps/)
* Achieve fast fulfillment by [raising delivery speed

  ](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-speed/)
* [Plan 10,000 deliveries per day](https://elogii.com/blog/route-planning-strategy-100-vs-10000/) (vs. 100 per month)


* [Save as much as 42% of your operational costs](https://elogii.com/blog/construction-materials-delivery/)




All of that means that route planning (static and dynamic together) have +265% ROI.




(At least with the right tool.)




But before that, here’s what you need to know about static route planning:

 




## What Is Static Route Planning?

Static route planning, or just route planning, is the process of planning a route with multiple stops for drivers for any future time or date. 




This means you can use static routing to plan single trips, routes with multiple stops on a daily, weekly, monthly, and recurring basis, including routes that span multiple days, before the driver sets off on his run.




## How Does Static Route Planning Work?

Static route planning is route planning.




To learn more about how it works we suggest that you read this [guide on route planning](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-optimize-route-planning/).




## Examples of Static Routing




* Example #1: Routes with Multiple Stops

This static route example involves planning a route with multiple stops or destinations.




The order of the stops is predetermined and it’s rarely changed.




A real-life example would be planning a delivery route for a courier service with multiple stops in a particular sequence.




* Example #2: Routes Across Multiple Days

This type of static route planning involves planning a route that spans multiple days.




For example, planning a road trip with multiple destinations across different states or countries that require several days to cover.




* Example #3: Routes for Future Dates 

This type of static route planning involves planning a route for a future date or event.




For example, planning a route to attend a music festival or a sports event that is scheduled to happen in the future.




## Pros and Cons of Static Route Planning

Effective route planning is vital to the success of any delivery operation.




Although dynamic routing software is widely used in the industry, traditional static routing configuration has several benefits, but drawbacks, too.




### Pros of Static Routing

* You Can Do It Manually

You don’t need software or a high-tech computer to create a static route.




What you need is a pen and paper along with razor-sharp focus and a list of stops.




Those are the things you need to create a plan for routine deliveries.




That makes static routing a cost-effective and accessible option for businesses with limited resources.




* You Can Easily Learn the Traffic Patterns

Another advantage of static routing is that it allows drivers to become familiar with their delivery routes and usual traffic patterns.




The same goes for route planners.




By consistently driving and viewing the same route and its same stops, drivers and route planners can save time and become more efficient at their jobs.




That leads to increased productivity and profitability.




* You can Load Vehicles in Advance

Pre-planning delivery stops through static routing allow drivers to load vehicles in advance.




That saves time and increases efficiency, enabling drivers to hit the road faster and focus on delivering goods to customers.




* Less Expensive than Dynamic Routing

Lastly, static routing is less expensive than dynamic routing software because it doesn't require much computing power and bandwidth.




You can even do it by hand.




This makes it a practical option for smaller businesses with a limited budget.




### Cons of Static Routing

* Often unreliable ETAs

Static routing allows you to establish regular delivery windows with your customers.




But it doesn't adjust for real-time traffic, weather changes, or other unexpected delays.




This can result in wider time windows or less reliable ETAs compared to dynamic routing, which takes into account real-time data.




* Not Flexible for Last-minute Changes

Unexpected delivery requests, priority orders, and same-day deliveries are challenging to manage with a static route.




Determining the best time to fit them in or if there is enough time at all can be a struggle.




Dynamic routing is better equipped to handle these changes by quickly adjusting routes based on real-time conditions.




## Key Differences: Dynamic Routing vs. Static Routing

Let’s view the top differences between static and dynamic routing.

![dynamic-routing-vs-static-routing](/blog/uploads/dynamic-routing-vs-static-routing.png "dynamic-routing-vs-static-routing")

## Why Should You Use Static Routing Over Dynamic Routing?




Between static and dynamic routing, there are a few reasons why you might be better off with static routing:




* You have predictable delivery routes




With static routing, businesses can pre-plan their delivery routes.




That predictability can lead to better customer satisfaction and increased efficiency.

* You are a smaller company with predictable order volumes

Smaller companies that don’t have that many orders to fulfill often don’t require real-time data that much.




* You have a tight budget

Not only do you do static routing manually, but even if you do it through software, you’ll save money, as dynamic routing asks for more software features, which means paying a higher price.




* You’re concerned about your privacy

As static routing means using little to no technology, there is less cyber risk involved.




Especially as dynamic routing involves complex algorithms which connect to a larger router network.




## Why Should You Use Dynamic Routing Over Static Routing?

* You can better handle unexpected events

Static routing falls short for fleet managers to react to unforeseen events.




Dynamic routing offers quick solutions by reassigning tasks and finding efficient routes with real-time optimization software.




So if a vehicle breaks down between two stops, fleet dispatchers can find a solution quickly.




* You have better control over cutting costs

As dynamic routing requires software to work, there are a lot of things you can monitor.




And that means you can even get alerts for speeding drivers. Acting quickly and curbing such behavior reflects lower fuel expenses for fuel, repair costs, and insurance.




* You get precise stop sequencing

Sequencing is crucial for route optimization.




Static routing often leads to missed delivery windows, particularly when the drop-off site is far.




Dynamic routing automates sequencing, considering driver workload and delivery constraints for efficient routes in seconds.




It works by simply inputting addresses and finding the best route.




* You also get accurate ETAs

Consumers demand faster and more accurate delivery windows.




Static routing's broad delivery window is no longer enough to deliver on customer expectations.




Dynamic routing with real-time tracking provides efficient routes and accurate ETAs.




It reduces missed deliveries and improves customer satisfaction for loyal patrons.




## Why Should You Use Both Dynamic and Static Routing?




Why choose one if you could enjoy both static and dynamic routing?




We’ve established by now how much dynamic routing software can enhance your efficiency and profits.




But why should that be enough to push those who still primarily rely on static routing to move to software?




The answer is hybrid routing.




This is a game-changing approach that blends the predictability of static routing with the adaptability of dynamic routing.




You get these static and dynamic routing in the same planning process. 




With hybrid routing, your fleet drivers start each day with their established fixed route and use a dynamic routing app, such as eLogii.




The software further optimizes the route for real-time conditions and customer location.




That enables drivers to provide a better customer experience, save time and fuel, and increase their earnings.




Some stops remain the same, while other ones are dynamically optimized around the “anchor” stops.




Let’s paint this benefit through food and beverage logistics:




In food delivery, you have to pay attention to the tiniest of details.




For instance, if you’re delivering lunch to a customer’s company, you’ll find yourself in a hassle if your driver shows up in the middle of the company’s lunch rush.




That would leave them without anyone to accept the delivery and nowhere to park.




That scenario can happen with automatic route planning, which can leave your biggest customer right in the middle of the lunch rush.




Static routing, on the other hand, has its drawbacks, too.




It can’t compete in the highly saturated food and beverage industry, where margins are thin.




And there is always the chance that you’ve been using one static route for so long that you can’t tell with confidence if you should adjust it again.




So, to recap:

Static routing = predictability and reliability, but also inefficiency and inflexibility.




Dynamic routing = flexibility and automatization, but also chaos and unpredictability.




Food distributors need a method to route planning that combines static and dynamic routing.




Here is how you can take it to the next level:




You can map out different customers into tiers, allowing the routing software to dynamically organize stops based on specified parameters for each customer.




Let’s say you have a Tuesday order scheduled for a middle-tier customer, but the delivery time isn’t very important.




The routing software will sequence the stop accordingly.




Using the same logic, you can codify fallback time windows for particular customers and default to those if you can’t meet the preferred time window.




Here are the two most glaring benefits of hybrid routing:

* It increases capacity utilization.

It achieves this by dynamically routing stops related to smaller customers around your statically routed anchors.




That enables you to find the most efficient routes daily!




In case of changes, such as volume change, last-minute orders, or sudden new customers, you can handle them without going back to the drawing board. 




* It improves agility and flexibility.

It allows you to model potential changes.




So instead of wondering how you handle sudden obstacles, you can try and predict the outcomes of various situations.




Then, if a problem arises, you can quickly execute the best option.




## How Does Dynamic Route Planning Software Work?

Dynamic routing relies on software with complex algorithms.




They create optimized routes in minutes if not seconds.




The eLogii software is simple to use in this sense.




Once you download it from the Apple or Google store, you can easily set up your account and add stops on routes.




Then, you enter additional information such as ETAs, average time for each stop, and priority orders.




As soon as you choose the optimization button, eLogii quickly tests out virtually huge numbers of route options.




It does that so it could find the most efficient sequence of stops.




Naturally, eLogii also relies on GPS to find the most cost-effective route.




And dynamic routing software like eLogii is static-route-friendly, too! What do we mean by this?




For instance, if you use the same master route every day, it’s easy to duplicate it and optimize it for your new day of deliveries!




And you can add or delete a stop from your route in progress in just a couple of steps.




Then you get a re-optimized route to continue on your way.
