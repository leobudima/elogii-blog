This is a SUPER in-depth review of eLogii’s last mile tracking.

In this up-to-date review we’ll break down:

* What is final mile tracking
* What makes eLogii’s tracking so special
* How can you use it for internal tracking
* How to use it to improve delivery experience
* Key features
* Things our users like
* Whether or not it’s worth the price
* Lots more

Let’s get started.

## What is last mile delivery tracking?

**Last mile tracking** refers to location tracking of vehicles, drivers, and orders (packages) across the final stage of fulfillment (or last mile). That is to say, from the time an order is picked up from a warehouse or depot center, to the moment it reaches the customer’s address.

This is critical for delivery managers and customers, alike. That’s why last mile visibility has to work both ways: **internal tracking** and **customer-facing**.

This ensures three key things:

* Delivery ops are running efficiently across the entire last mile
* Customers are receiving their orders at the right place and time
* Transparency over the process for an amazing delivery experience

And to achieve all of that successfully, you’ll need delivery management software.

## What is eLogii, exactly?

**eLogii** is a route optimization and delivery management software solution.

Our top feature is the route optimization.

This feature automatically plans optimal routes around last mile efficiency. Which you can do for multiple stops for multiple drivers in seconds, in real-time or days or weeks in advance.

And around constraints that impact your efficiency the most: fuel and transportation costs, order volumes, scalability, planning time, employee performance, and more.

In other words, eLogii automates how you plan, manage, and optimize your last mile to make it more efficient.

And you can see an estimate of that efficiency in dollars when you [visit this link](https://elogii.com/roi).

Once we’ve filled out the form, here’s what we got for a (made-up) fleet of ten vehicles:

Now:

## How does eLogii fit into last mile tracking?

eLogii isn’t just a route planning and optimization tool. It’s also delivery management software.

That means you can use it not just to plan operations, but also to dispatch fleets and drivers, and **monitor and control their activities during the entire delivery process**.

And that requires last mile tracking.

But before that, you’ll need something to track.

So let’s go through that quickly.

## Setting up eLogii for last mile tracking

When you first login to eLogii, you land on the dashboard:

This is where you’ll configure the software to create a virtual model of your delivery.

From depots:

To vehicles:

And driver profiles:

After you’re set up, the first thing you’ll want to do with eLogii is to import tasks (deliveries).

You can do this manually:

Or via CSV Import:

After that, you’ll need to plan driver routes for deliveries around a specific date:

Once you’re done, and hit _Save_, all of the deliveries are assigned and automatically dispatched to drivers via the Driver App:

And when the drivers set off on their routes that’s when the tracking begins.

## Monitoring Screen: Using eLogii for internal last mile tracking

If you hit _Monitoring_ at the top of the dashboard, you head over to eLogii’s last mile tracking screen.

As you can see, the screen is basically divided into three parts.

On the left side of the dashboard, you have access to:

* **Main menu:** This is where you can toggle between the map, and a detailed overview of all tasks (deliveries), depots, drivers, etc.

* **Task filter:** Here you can filter tasks by their status: _Pending_, _In Progress_, _Completed_, and _Failed_.

* **Depot locations:** This shows all of your depot locations. Selecting any one of them will display it on the map.

* **Task status** (_filter results_): Here you can see the percentage of completed tasks, no. of late tasks, average time per delivery, max. delivery time, and the status of all tasks.

The middle of the dashboard is really only reserved for one thing:

* **Tracking map: Here’s where you track last mile operations in real time. From different driver routes, through depot locations, to all of the pick-up and drop-off stops on each route.**

On the right side of the dashboard, you have:

* **Task list:** A detailed view of all tasks. Each task box has an ID no., drop off address, starting location, vehicle load, ETA, and time to completion. You can drag and drop items manually to set the route order (which automatically initiates reoptimization to adjust the route). You also have the ability to hide completed tasks or mark those at the same location.

* **Route, driver, and vehicle filter**: Here you select what you want to track on the map. For example, filtering by driver will display driver profiles. Each box displays: driver name and ID, vehicle model, % of load capacity that’s delivered, % of time to complete tasks, distance covered, work hours, team, etc. Clicking on the driver’s box will display their tasks and highlight their route on the map.

* **Task status filter**: Similar to the filter on the left side, here you can toggle between tasks that are _Assigned_, _Unassigned_, and _Unavailable_ (to drivers, vehicles, or teams).

This is how you use eLogii for internal last mile tracking.

But you’re not limited to just your internal fleet.

## API Integration and Webhooks: Using eLogii for carrier tracking

Make no mistake:

eLogii last mile tracking isn’t just for in-house delivery fleets.

No.

Instead, eLogii supports internal final mile tracking even if you:

* Outsource delivery to a carrier or third-party provider
* Provide delivery services as a carrier or 3PL
* Use a mix of internal and external delivery fleets

And it does this via API integration.

APIs provide 2-way integration between eLogii and other third-party apps that you use.

This gives you access in and out to core functionality. (Including last mile tracking.)

Let’s say you use a last mile carrier to support your delivery fleet.

You can use the APIs and webhooks to integrate with the carrier’s tracking software.

eLogii will generate an API key. This is a simple way to authenticate the integration.

After that you can set up webhooks to generate data from the carrier’s app on the dashboard.

When it comes to tracking, these include:

* Task Lifecycle Update
* Task Update
* Task / Driver Tracking Update

**Keep in mind:** You need a developer for this and the help of our support team.

You can do this if you outsource the entire delivery to a carrier. To get greater visibility over the operations.

Or if you’re a third-party logistics provider, to provide greater transparency to your customers.

Which brings us to…

## Tracking links: Using eLogii for customer-facing delivery tracking

This feature let’s customers track their deliveries across the last mile:

In other words, tracking links enable you to provide customers with what they want:

**Information about their orders in real time**.

That answers their most burning questions:

* What is the status of my delivery?
* What is the driver’s location?
* When is my delivery going to arrive?

On the surface, this customer-facing tracking page is the same as with most other solutions out there (like Onfleet or Bringg).

Like those other tools, the software generates a tracking link. And then it automatically sends it to the customer via email or SMS.

What makes eLogii different from other delivery management software?

First off, you can completely customize the tracking page in more detail.

This includes what you want to display and how you want the page to display it:

Custom parameters for greater transparency:

The wording on labels for each delivery status:

And even the style of the page itself:

This is sneaky important.

Let’s say a customer wants to know when their delivery will arrive (estimated time of arrival ETA). And you have too many orders that day and you worry deliveries will arrive late.

But you don’t want to hide ETA information from the tracking page. So what do you do?

In fact, you have two options:

You can input an ETA text message instead of a precise ETA.

Or you can add an ETA time span around the closest 15-minute interval.

That way you protect your brand. And provide maximum transparency for a great delivery experience.

Good luck doing that with a precise ETA on a busy day.

(Which you always do when things are running smoothly.)

The other strong point about eLogii’s customer-facing delivery tracking is the auto-arrive geofence feature:

This lets you set an automatic status update when a driver is within range of the customer.

For example, if you set the location radius to 200 meters around the task location, it will automatically trigger a status update once the driver comes within that range.

And that works for all tasks. So yeah, you can use it for pick-ups as well.

Finally, you can provide customers access to their own dedicated dashboard.

This is a HUGE deal when you work a lot in B2B delivery. And you want to push for that extra transparency for your best customers.

Especially if they do a lot of business with you. And they want to get insight into the locations of all of the orders you’re handling for them.

## eLogii’s additional features that help with last mile tracking

There are several other intuitive features that eLogii provides that makes it great for last mile tracking. And which other tools lack.

And in this part of the article, we’ll quickly look at some of them.

But you can always book a demo to go through each feature in more detail.

So what else makes eLogii great for delivery tracking:

### #1 Map animation

Map animation is eLogii’s answer to visual lag.

This feature simplifies the map view in the operations screen.

So if you’re running large delivery (10,000+ tasks per day) this prevents lag without limiting visibility over your operations.

Or putting unnecessary pressure on your system’s performance.

### #2 Cash-on-delivery

eLogii provides several types of proof of delivery.

This includes capturing PODs via photos, signature, barcode or QR code verification.

And you can add cash-on-delivery as part of your workflow.

It also allows you drivers to collect amounts lower than the order value, with a comment.

For example, if the driver misses the customer during his initial delivery attempt.

### #3 Driver Telemetry

Driver telemetry enables eLogii’s users to view live driver data.

The dashboard is connected to your driver’s phone via the Driver App.

This gives eLogii the ability to access live data about the phone.

And to display it as valuable information about the driver on the dashboard, such as the driver’s current speed, whether he’s currently walking or driving, or his last entry to the app.

## eLogii Support

How does eLogii’s support stack up?

Well, we decided to run a little experiment (without our colleagues knowing) to find out.

First, we hit the “support” button at the bottom right-hand corner on the website.

So we wrote a question about delivery tracking and got immediately notified by the AI-bot:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pNe6QaAA5YLePwqYIclpE0L0-s4wK92kulyPbxwTqug_G_hrJpZ6Mz_V0xgukyKJJL-cyWRmiQHNT5zUgmRSOWNsKzzSXgibW_Z8nl9n3rkvqscgZ2tEbQxL0Mme7pvteNKGNHQnLiS-w7g4NQ =461x712)

No choosing an “issue category” or anything too complicated. Just a simple chat. Which we appreciate.

You could also leave your email address to get notified sooner.

(But that would defeat the purpose of us getting under cover!)

And exactly 22 minutes later, our colleagues came back to us with a reply:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9WCq729MpRA05TEqhrAtG1eAn3LjO6aRtRTS2kysf3klDh1yitk0MJr9UzjiOrW09HdVb2-xRV8dYNLKNoDNyNTZdH84ig9t4Koo5y-IxvIB-BTffL_FFAaSFoNdboIINZ4qo6HgUkt6TaoG6g =462x719)

22 minutes is REALLY fast! Still, we did reach out to them at the start of their shift and from the same time zone. But they typically do answer queries within a few hours even if that’s not the case.

Overall, the response itself is solid. We would have liked an in-message explanation. But the help center article did clarify a lot. And the option to book a demo for a 1-on-1 explanation was surely a bonus.

So, overall, we’d rate the support team with an A.

## What companies using eLogii have to say:

Hundreds of customers have been using (and paying for) eLogii since 2020.

And many of them are satisfied with the software’s performance.

As you can see on [GetApp](https://www.getapp.com/transportation-logistics-software/a/elogii/):

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KB3t18gz-DlWBrePiNJtCtWPdLhf1MuuXEJeP59eWRzJQGc7n0rsClm88s2ooicYeC6k6cZ2uhTcHUhUuo3cJEhKpcJY365Byf6e3hOZfO1Eph84fCPYpQ6UbUBsF1-DwfEvhkkTRykUg0myyQ =466x897)

And [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/202055/eLogii/):

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/K68ZTCNlI0ZGDEongw4Od1SxKqbdJWAHVKoX1ouw8l0kpII95U80b0b5TVQqdaCUvlR_G3lVPmRgyKvLQ6OwmR-NRBvcf6dsByBVq9fxog3d391h6T2QMrZYtC2cZlyjm6YXklVw--FCdAuiBA =624x376)

So we wanted to touch on customer results from using the tool in the last three years.

And answer the big question that you probably have right now:

**Does eLogii help you better track deliveries and last mile operations?**

Overall, we can draw a straight line from using eLogii to better tracking. But also higher performance and greater efficiency.

And based on customer results you too can see an estimate for your delivery if you [click here](https://elogii.com/roi?utm_content=CjwKCAjw4ayUBhA4EiwATWyBrsZhyiT3NSbyFeXBHOR4w6dBZbtdUUsMvdRUnuEvyRrYYh_9IpaEiRoC4hEQAvD_BwE).

But don’t take our word for it.

Here’s a quick preview of some of the great reviews that we’ve been getting:

“Very responsive customer service team, fun product to implement. This product will save your drivers time, your dispatchers time, and lots of money in mileage.”

"eLogii has the ability to take pictures, enter notes, which again is great help when talking about damage claims."

“It's fresh. Warehouse and map are looking good.”

“eLogii is a time saver to have so many features in one place. It replaces 3 or 4 different tools, combined into one. This is a huge time saver on day-to-day operations.”

“The system is easy to use, and very effective for helping plan delivery of our goods using our fleet of trucks. An Electronic Proof Of Delivery (E-POD) helps eliminate questions and disputes.”

So we can say that, overall, **eLogii has helped our customers improve how they manage operations**. Not only with delivery tracking. But with other features that make it SUPER easy to plan and organize their last mile.

Which, at least to our customers, makes eLogii worth using.

## eLogii Pricing

A review of eLogii’s last mile tracking just wouldn’t be complete without talking about pricing.

eLogii has three plans on offer: Starter, Premium, and Professional.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/flWHE9ahl9untM_9beV8J0GNAdpzzbX_Gd8bqt5z20IXCVxdzU9Nok4ZwtUVu6xM3S4Qmo_1imgNr_k1JEITikP98m7Fv--WRjlYWoZ-agLHur5KuGmNl4uS0zEGehnr33ixM5rTCCUcvp8qmA =624x240)

Plans start at $359 with an annual commitment.

But that’s not all that different from other tools.

Both in terms of pricing and functionality.

Tools like [Onfleet](https://elogii.com/blog/onfleet-competitors/), [Optimoroute](https://elogii.com/blog/optimoroute-competitors/), [Tookan](https://elogii.com/blog/tookan-alternatives/), and even [Bringg](https://elogii.com/blog/bringg-competitors/).

Comparing eLogii to other software suites isn’t a 1:1 comparison. eLogii is pretty unique.

And it provides live driver on-map monitoring and live tracking even with a Starter Plan.

That said, in terms of pricing, eLogii is definitely a serious investment.

## eLogii Last Mile Tracking Bottom Line: Is eLogii worth it?

Keep in mind that we’re a little biased here, but:

If delivery is a big part of your business strategy, then eLogii is definitely worth its relatively high price tag.

At first glance, $359 may seem like a lot for a delivery management tool. And it is.

But a software’s value is based on the ROI that it gives you.

In other words: Would you rather spend $1k/month on an amazing tool than $50/month on a tool that doesn’t help your business all that much?

And if you feel that a boost in delivery efficiency can significantly lower your operational costs and generate more sales and orders than $359/month, then we suggest you give eLogii a shot.

Plus, eLogii compares really well against other [automated last-mile delivery solutions](https://elogii.com/blog/automated-last-mile-delivery/).

That said: if you’re just starting a delivery service. Or you have a limited software budget. Or you’re new to delivery logistics. Then you should pass on delivery software all together. (For now, at least.)

But if delivery is a big part of your business, we recommend trying eLogii.

And if you’re still not convinced, then…
