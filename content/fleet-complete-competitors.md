But, a question arises:

What is the best Fleet Complete alternative for your specific use case?

This is where we jump to your aid because in this blog we’ll:

1. Briefly review Fleet Complete’s functionality and use cases, so we can better compare it to its competitors

This way, by the time you’ve read this article through, you’ll be well informed to make the right decision.

## TLDR

* Fleet Complete is an outdated fleet management system that lacks the necessary functionality for comprehensive fleet and delivery management
* eLogii is a powerful delivery management solution with a massive number of features, customisation options and flexible pricing plans which makes it the perfect choice for a wide variety of businesses
* Eroad is a fleet management system that offers more advanced functionality than Fleet Complete but also lacks the ability to provide all-around delivery management. Its pricing makes it a good fit for smaller fleets

To achieve this, we have:

1. Interviewed several dozen past and current users of every platform

Let’s dive straight in!

## Fleet Complete - Overview

![Fleet Complete UI](/blog/uploads/fleet-complete-ui.png "Fleet Complete UI")

Fleet Complete is a [fleet management system](https://elogii.com/blog/benefits-of-fleet-management-systems/) that’s supposed to ensure that delivery vehicles work as efficiently, quickly, and safely as possible.

However, Fleet Complete isn’t that adept at tackling all the challenges of modern fleet and delivery management, as we’ll shortly see.

### What functionality does Fleet Complete offer?

Fleet Complete seems to offer an impressive number of different features that are supposed to help clients take care of every single bit of the complex fleet management process.

Some of its most notable functions include:

* A **dual-facing dashcam** and video telematics – the camera enables you to monitor your drivers in real-time, as well as record all kinds of events on the road (e.g., accidents, crashes, driving violations, etc.) which you can then review later. You’ll also provide drivers with live in-cab coaching and alert them anytime they engage in risky driving

![Fleet Complete Videos](/blog/uploads/fleet-complete-videos.png "Fleet Complete Videos")

* **Vehicle inspection** options – as it’s mandatory for drivers to inspect their vehicles before, during and after their trips (especially when it comes to multi-day long-distance routes) the option for electronic logging of all the necessary data can make that process a whole lot easier

![Fleet Complete Driver’s report](/blog/uploads/fleet-complete-driver-s-report.JPG "Fleet Complete Driver’s report")

* **Fleet tracking** – this includes options for geofencing and zoning, location tracking of each vehicle, and reports on overall vehicle performance (e.g., idling time, distance traveled, the incidence of harsh braking events, etc.)

![Fleet Complete Tracking](/blog/uploads/fleet-complete-tracking.png "Fleet Complete Tracking")

* **Delivery and field service management** – here, Fleet Complete has some **pretty basic options** like customer email notifications to inform them that their delivery has arrived, an ETA board for all the vehicles on the road, a few POD collection methods, etc. When it comes to field service management in particular, Fleet Complete enables users to track their staff’s location and availability in real-time, allow self-assigning of tasks, and more.

If you need a more detailed analysis of Fleet Complete’s features, user experience, and use cases, you can check out our [in-depth Fleet Complete review](https://elogii.com/blog/fleet-complete-reviews/).

### What are Fleet Complete’s shortcomings?

Unfortunately, despite having such vast functionality, Fleet Complete suffers from quite a few drawbacks:

* It has a **dated**, **unintuitive interface** that’s very complex to navigate, even for experienced users
* The dashcam is supposed to be automatically triggered in case of a crash or a traffic violation, but it **often fails to work properly**
* More often than not Fleet Complete’s **ELD device takes wrong records**, doesn’t track the drivers’ rest as required by law, and lags when delivering reports
* Fleet Complete **has a separate app for almost every function** – there’s an app for in-cab coaching and driver monitoring, an app for ELD reading and logging, an app for vehicle inspection, an app for couriers and one for on-field service providers… You get the idea. The sheer number of apps users have to install and interact with results in a lousy overall user experience
* It has **no features that ensure customer satisfaction**, e.g. automated notifications from each critical stage of the route with ETAs, failed delivery workflows, live communication between drivers and customers, customer feedback options, etc.
* There are **no advanced routing options** available

### How much does Fleet Complete cost?

When it comes to Fleet Complete’s pricing, there’s nothing we can say for sure, as they haven’t disclosed their price on-site.

This isn’t strange in itself, as many similar services don’t have an off-the-shelf price, but Fleet Complete doesn’t even hint at its pricing policy.

We can’t say whether they charge per asset and if there’s a minimal number of assets your fleet has to have, if each solution (i.e. app) is charged separately and if there are discounts if you opt for several of them.

To get a quote, you will have to contact them directly.

Some reviews, however, do mention that clients have paid [thousands of dollars for a fleet of 25 trucks](https://www.capterra.com/p/79292/Fleet-Complete/reviews/3388552/), so it’s **safe to assume that Fleet Complete isn’t exactly a bargain**.

### Who should use Fleet Complete?

It’s hard to say which businesses would benefit the most from using Fleet Complete.

Judging from all we’ve seen so far, and especially when you consider customer reviews, it would seem that **Fleet Complete isn’t that good of an option for any business**.

The UI that looks like it’s from the 90s at best and the omission of some essential features make Fleet Complete an obsolete platform that won’t do you any good.

The fact that you have to download and install several different apps to get all their features is another major downside, as it only complicates your life and workflow instead of simplifying them by relieving you of tedious, menial tasks.

## Fleet Complete competitor #1: eLogii – A comprehensive delivery management solution perfect for businesses of all types and sizes

eLogii is a dedicated last-mile delivery management & optimization platform with a wide range of cutting-edge features.

![eLogii UI](/blog/uploads/elogii-ui.JPG "eLogii UI")

eLogii’s rich functionality enables it to easily take care of all the crucial aspects of last-mile delivery, including:

* Route planning and optimization
* Customer satisfaction
* Overall operational efficiency

### Why choose eLogii over Fleet Complete?

eLogii is a much more sophisticated platform than Fleet Complete in virtually every aspect.

Whereas Fleet Complete is solely a fleet management system that lacks the functionality needed for comprehensive delivery management, eLogii is focused exactly on optimizing the entire delivery process.

As such, eLogii has numerous cutting-edge features, including:

* **Advanced routing options** - such as **dynamic routing** (meaning that it automatically adjusts routes to various unforeseen events, such as current traffic density and jams, accidents, weather conditions, road blocks, etc.), **live vehicle tracking, multi-day** and **multi-depot routing** for long-distance haulage and shared fleets, **“return to depot”** functionality for drivers to reload, etc.

![eLogii dynamic routing](/blog/uploads/elogii-dynamic-routing.png "eLogii dynamic routing")

* Options for providing unparalleled customer service - such as sending **precise ETA notifications** from every stage of the delivery and their instant live updates (if anything changes on the road), enabling customers to **track their order in real-time**, allowing them to **easily leave feedback**, etc.

![eLogii customer notifications](/blog/uploads/elogii-customer-notifications.JPG "eLogii customer notifications")

* **Widest range of POD collection methods**, including barcode and QR code scanning, as well as cash-on-delivery confirmation
* A **massive number of configurable parameters** that ensure maximum operational efficiency (e.g. matching tasks to particular driver skills, building tolerances for late/early deliveries into routing and timing, allowing customers to change their delivery addresses or opt for BOPIS)
* **Loads can be automatically matched to the most suitable vehicles** based on volume, weight, pallet numbers - or the availability of specific features (e.g., refrigeration, tail lift, etc.)

![eLogii – Vehicle configuration](/blog/uploads/elogii-vehicle-configuration.jpg "eLogii – Vehicle configuration")

* Ability to set up **workflows in case of a failed delivery** for drivers to follow (e.g. return it to depot, leave it with a neighbor, or in another designated safe location)

![eLogii failed workflow](/blog/uploads/elogii-failed-workflow.JPG "eLogii failed workflow")

* Best in class [API and webhooks](https://api-docs.elogii.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw682TBhATEiwA9crl38-FdcvmlPsQPvzkaLG_kU23DUFytKyNn2CZXxBS7ulh6Bdoy4uGARoCR6kQAvD_BwE) for easy integration with the wider supply chain

![eLogii api](/blog/uploads/elogii-api.png "eLogii api")

### How do eLogii and Fleet Complete compare in price?

eLogii’s pricing policy is much more straightforward and leaves no room for nasty surprises, although no fixed prices are disclosed on-site either.

Namely, eLogii doesn’t have one-size-fits-all pricing packages, which makes it an **ideal solution for small, medium, and large businesses alike**.

eLogii comes with **custom-tailored pricing plans** based on your business’s particular configuration and needs, with the typical entry-level price starting at around $359 per month for 2500 tasks.

Each plan includes **unlimited users, drivers, and vehicles**, which is a great option for larger businesses or those aiming to scale.

![elogii pricing](/blog/uploads/elogii-pricing.png "elogii pricing")

You can [compare each plan’s features](https://elogii.com/plans-and-features?utm_content=Cj0KCQjwidSWBhDdARIsAIoTVb3rzMUA0BtUIPyXleIaPk7ODhqHDEWXrpWW_HCGKoi2omXmaU7DErUaAuT1EALw_wcB) on their webpage for a detailed overview of what each eLogii’s package includes.

### Who should use eLogii?

Its wide range of cutting-edge functionality and plenty of customisation options combined with its custom-tailored pricing plans make **eLogii the perfect choice for businesses of all types and sizes.**

eLogii’s overall flexibility allows it to deliver excellent results for verticals as diverse as medical and pharmaceutical, food and drink, 3PL, couriers - and everything in between.

The only businesses that wouldn’t benefit much from eLogii are micro businesses that have fewer than 2500 tasks per month and small companies that don’t need as many advanced features.

## Fleet Complete competitor #2: Eroad – A more robust fleet management system

![eroad UI](/blog/uploads/eroad-ui.png "eroad UI")

Eroad is a fleet management platform available in New Zealand, Australia, and the USA.

A version of Eroad is also available in Europe, but it has a significantly smaller number of capabilities, which is a point worth mentioning for European-based businesses.

### Why choose Eroad over Fleet Complete?

Although Eroad suffers from some of the typical fleet management systems’ shortcomings, it’s still a better choice than Fleet Complete because:

* Eroad has more advanced **asset tracking capabilities** – Eroad’s asset tracking device enables users to know the exact location of each vehicle at any given moment, helps with finding stolen or lost vehicles and provides information about vehicle health

![Eroad – Tracking](/blog/uploads/eroad-tracking.png "Eroad – Tracking")

* It has a cold chain assurance device that helps users maintain the right temperature in the trailer when transporting sensitive loads. It alerts users on temperature oscillations, and warns them in case the trailer door is left open
* Eroad enables electronic IFTA recordkeeping – this option significantly simplifies the process of recordkeeping and paying motor fuel taxes for US and Canadian businesses

![Eroad – IFTA Report](/blog/uploads/eroad-ifta-report.png "Eroad – IFTA Report")

* It is strong on **stats reports**

However, Eroad lacks the features necessary for all-around delivery management and optimization, which is a point worth considering if you need more than just fleet management.

Moreover, Eroad is fairly complex to use and has only [long-term contracts](https://www.getapp.com/transportation-logistics-software/a/eroad/reviews/8208dd7a11/).

### How do Eroad and Fleet Complete compare in price?

Just like with Fleet Complete, we cannot provide you with too much information on Eroad’s pricing, as Eroad doesn’t provide this off-the-peg.

What we do know for sure is that it charges users on a per-vehicle basis and that the plans can start at **$25 per vehicle per month**, provided **you buy some of their hardware devices up front**. If not, the pricing **starts at $35 per month**.

![Eroad – Pricing](/blog/uploads/eroad-pricing.png "Eroad – Pricing")

Furthermore, Eroad has separate pricing plans for heavy and light vehicles: there are 4 plans for heavy and 2 for light vehicles.

![Eroad Heavy Vehicles Plan](/blog/uploads/eroad-heavy-vehicle-plans.png "Eroad Heavy Vehicles Plan")

![Eroad – Light Vehicle Plans](/blog/uploads/eroad-light-vehicle-plans.png "Eroad – Light Vehicle Plans")

### Who should use Eroad?

Eroad could be a fit for companies that:

1. Need a fleet management solution rather than a delivery management one
2. Are based in North America, Australia, or New Zealand
3. Have smaller fleets

Eroad is **not a viable option for European-based businesses** because it cannot offer that many attractive features yet.

Furthermore, **businesses with large fleets** will find that **Eroad isn’t the most economical solution** due to its per-vehicle pricing and the fact they will have to make additional purchases of Eroad’s hardware.

Either way, if you do need a fleet management system, Eroad is definitely a more solid choice than Fleet Complete in every respect.

On the other hand, **companies looking for comprehensive delivery management**, with a specific focus on [last-mile delivery](https://elogii.com/blog/automated-last-mile-delivery/), will be better off with a different kind of solution altogether.

## Fleet Complete competitor #3: Bringg – Fit for enterprises looking to manage the entire supply chain

![Bringg UI](/blog/uploads/bringg-ui.JPG "Bringg UI")

Bringg was founded in 2013 to help big retailers compete with Amazon

The way Bringg enables this is by orchestrating entire supply chains and logistics operations as well as by helping businesses connect with third-party logistics providers.

### Why choose Bringg over Fleet Complete?

Unlike Fleet Complete, Bringg is a comprehensive delivery management solution, with a specific focus on managing the entire supply chain and logistics process.

Because of this, Bringg has several notable advantages over Fleet Complete:

* It provides a **highly customisable customer experience** – as part of the intention to compete with Amazon, Bringg lets customers change their delivery and drop-off locations and supports BOPIS (buy online, pick up in-store)
* Bringg is just as geared towards supplier-to-warehouse logistics as towards warehouse-to-customer. This means that Bringg is an **entire platform dedicated to end-to-end logistics operations**. As such, it can deal with high volumes of tasks and highly complex demands
* It has **various routing features** (e.g., route optimization, live tracking, etc.)
* Has options for **collecting POD**

On the other hand, it’s worth knowing that **Bringg has an outdated UI** - similar to Fleet Complete. In addition, Bringg’s mobile app for drivers is often buggy and tricky to use.

Moreover, **Bringg’s API can be very challenging to work with**. There are inconsistencies in the documentation (e.g. “task,” “delivery,” and “order” are used interchangeably; some links are broken), the data models employed are often confusing, and a lot of the core app functionality is hard to configure. This makes integrating other technology more complex and slow to start.

### How do Bringg and Fleet Complete compare in price?

Because it’s primarily aimed at enterprises, it doesn’t surprise that Bringg is on the more expensive end of the pricing range.

Bringg’s pricing is not publicly available. Similarly to eLogii’s, it seems it’s based on the number of tasks (i.e. “orders”) since that’s a question you have to answer when booking a sales meeting.

![Bringg Pricing](/blog/uploads/bringg-pricing.JPG "Bringg Pricing")

However, it’s **safe to assume that the price is more than likely to be high**, primarily because of the supply chain features that come as part of the package.

Moreover, the lowest number of tasks is defined as under 30,000. Given that other platforms set out with much lower numbers of 2,000-3,000 tasks for their starter plans, Bringg is probably much more expensive than most - including LogiNext Mile, which isn’t a bargain to begin with.

### Who should use Bringg?

Bringg is **primarily aimed at large enterprises** in retail, food and grocery, and healthcare. Their customers include Wal-Mart, the Co-Op, Coca-Cola, and KFC.

While Bringg does have some smaller customers, its services are mostly tailored to big businesses, where deliveries and supply chains are integrated and can use both their delivery and backend management capabilities.

Smaller firms and those primarily focused on last-mile delivery won’t find Bringg to be a good fit for their needs.

## Best Fleet Complete competitors - The bottom line

Fleet Complete fails to adequately address all the challenges of contemporary fleet and delivery management. That’s why most businesses look for an alternative solution.

Eroad is a more robust and advanced fleet management system than Fleet Complete. However, it can work at its full potential only in the USA, New Zealand and Australia. Moreover, it's no good for all-around delivery management, and its per-asset pricing makes it viable only for companies with smaller fleets.

Bringg is an enterprise-oriented delivery management solution, with numerous features. This platform is a good choice only for the largest of businesses since they’re the only ones that can make the most of Bringg’s ability to manage the entire supply chain and can afford its price.

Finally, **eLogii** is a versatile delivery management platform whose **wide range of cutting-edge functionality**, **scalable pricing** plans and **high customisation** options make it the perfect solution for **all kinds of businesses regardless of size**.
