OnTime 360 is a delivery management software primarily aimed at couriers, messengers, and dispatchers that’s supposed to help them deal with all the challenges these services face nowadays.

As such, OnTime 360 does have some handy features, but is it the best choice for you?

Read on to find out, as in this blog, we’ll:

* Analyse OnTime 360’s core functionality and ease of use;
* Delve into its pricing policy;
* Highlight its best use cases;
* And offer alternative software for users who won’t find OnTime 360 that good of a fit.

## TLDR

* OnTime 360 is a relatively easy-to-use software designed to help couriers and similar transportation services to manage their delivery operations
* It lacks the functionality necessary for comprehensive last-mile delivery management (no vehicle load optimization, live dispatcher-driver chat, no customer notifications or ETAs, route optimization is charged extra, etc.)
* Its pricing and core functionality make OnTime 360 a good choice for couriers and similar services that have smaller fleets and modest delivery management needs
* eLogii is a perfect all-around last-mile delivery management solution for businesses of all types and sizes looking for a platform with cutting-edge features, flexible pricing, and versatile use cases

## OnTime 360 Reviews - Our methodology

We made sure to provide you with an in-depth insight into OnTime 360. To make that possible, we’ve:

1. Combed through customer reviews on reputable SaaS rating sites (e.g., Capterra, GetApp, G2);
2. Personally interviewed several dozen past and current users to find out what they liked - and disliked - the most about OnTime 360 and what they used it for primarily.

Moreover, since we’ve been in the delivery management space for quite a while now, we know exactly what to look for in a comprehensive [delivery management solution](https://elogii.com/blog/automated-last-mile-delivery/).

That’s why we’ve paid special attention to things such as:

* OnTime 360’s overall UX
* Its key features - and possible omissions of vital functionality;
* Its use cases - as most solutions are built with one (or two at best) primary use cases in mind;
* Pricing plans - since your budget plays a significant role in your decision.

Let’s begin to break these down one by one.

## OnTime 360 Reviews - Ease of use

Judging by its look and customer reviews, **OnTime 360 is fairly easy to use**.

Its interface is intuitive enough and shouldn’t pose too big of a problem even for users who’re not as tech-savvy or experienced with such software.

On the other hand, it does **appear pretty dated** since it has a very Windows-y look.

![OnTime 360 UI](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-ui.png "OnTime 360 UI")

When using it, you can feel like you’ve got stuck in the 90s, but since it’s pretty easy to manage, its look doesn’t matter as much.

However, when it comes to some more advanced functionality, such as filtering data for a clearer overview, things can get a bit tricky:

* There are quite a few options and several drop-down menus;
* The filters set-up sort of reminds of Excel’s functions a little.

![OnTime 360 Filters](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-filters.png "OnTime 360 Filters")

It’s also worth noting that OnTime 360 isn’t one comprehensive platform but a suite consisting of 4 different apps, including:

* OnTime Management
* OnTime Dispatch
* OnTime Mobile
* OnTime Customer Web Portal

### The verdict

Overall, OnTime’s interface is pretty user-friendly, although it’s not easy on the eye.

It will take users some more time to fully grasp its more advanced features, but even then, OnTime 360 is reasonably easy to use.

In addition, there’s a comprehensive learning base consisting of video tutorials, user guides, and articles.

Their support team is also pretty responsive if you need to contact them directly.

However, the fact that **it consists of as many as 4 different apps** might be too much of a complication for some.

## OnTime 360 Reviews - Core functionality

### 1. Customer Web Portal

Customer Web Portal is one of the four solutions OnTime 360 includes in their offering, although it’s only available with the Enterprise and higher plans.

It’s the feature most OnTime 360’s users list as their favourite.

![OnTime 360 Customer Web Portal](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-customer-web-portal.png "OnTime 360 Customer Web Portal")

Namely, this web portal can be integrated with their users’ websites, allowing them to offer their customers some pretty nifty options, such as:

* Creating their own orders and scheduling pickups
* Tracking things like the status of an order, the assigned driver, drop-off time, and other proof of delivery information, including the recipient’s signature
* Printing out their own shipping labels, waybills, and bills of lading
* Adding their list of addresses in case they have recurring shipments, etc.

It’s to be noted that when OnTime 360 speaks of customers, they **don’t mean the end recipient**, as is the case with most last-mile delivery management platforms.

OnTime 360’s customers are **senders**, i.e., **shippers** sending or dispatching their packages to a recipient.

That means **OnTime 360 lacks the functions that would provide recipients** with an unparalleled customer experience.

### 2. Dimensional weight calculator

Dimensional weight, or dim weight as it’s often referred to, is an essential parameter in courier and transportation services.

Namely, dim weight is the amount of space a package occupies in relation to its actual weight. For each shipment, senders are charged based on the dimensional weight or actual weight of the package - whichever is greater in a given case.

OnTime 360 comes with a dim weight calculator that allows users to easily generate the necessary factors and values for as many situations as they may need it.

![OnTime 360 Dim Weight Generator](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-dim-weight-generator.JPG "OnTime 360 Dim Weight Generator")

That enables users to provide their customers with precise and up-to-date info on the price of their shipment.

### 3. Order entry for easier navigation

This feature enables users to create a database of their regular customers.

Given that each customer has their own preferences, needs, regular pick-up and drop-off locations, or special requirements, storing that data in one place for quick access is much more convenient.

That makes all that critical data available to dispatchers whenever a customer wants to send a package.

That way, couriers and dispatchers can organize their workflow more quickly and efficiently instead of wasting time on manually entering all that information over and time again.

### 4. Routing and scheduling

Although OnTime 360 isn’t a route planning software per se, it does have some - although basic - routing capabilities.

It can calculate the distance between two points, has GPS navigation included in its mobile app, and can plot out drivers' routes and suggest the best order in which a driver is to visit each location for optimal results.

![OnTime 360 Routing](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-routing.png "OnTime 360 Routing")

Moreover, users can schedule pick-ups in advance, which enables better planning and organizing of drivers’ routes and workflows.

However, **OnTime 360 does not include advanced route optimization options in its plans** - they are **charged extra,** ranging from $0.15 to $0.33 per optimization. You can buy optimization credits in bulk, which will cost you from $20 to $300 a month (or more if you use them all before the end of a given month).

![OnTime 360 Optimization Price](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-optimization-price.png "OnTime 360 Optimization Price")

### 5. Tracking packages

OnTime 360 allows dispatchers, managers, owners, and shippers to track their packages easily.

![OnTime 360 Tracking](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-tracking.png "OnTime 360 Tracking")

The real-time status of any order can be seen in a comprehensive dashboard, enabling users to enter changes and edits. For example, it’s possible to:

* Reassign a package to a different driver;
* Immediately calculate the price difference, notify drivers, and take other measures if a customer changes their order in any way.

In addition, OnTime 360’s mobile app supports barcode scanning, which makes it easier to track and find each order in a matter of seconds.

### 6. Integration with QuickBooks

This feature is convenient for managers and owners as it allows them to easily integrate their accounting program - QuickBooks - with OnTime 360.

That way, they can easily post invoices and received payments from OnTime to QuickBooks.

![OnTime 360 QuickBooks](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-quickbooks.png "OnTime 360 QuickBooks")

Moreover, OnTime 360 enables users to automatically generate invoices and post payments.

### The verdict

OnTime 360 has several features couriers and similar transportation services can find very useful.

However, OnTime 360 is a far cry from a comprehensive delivery management software, as it lacks some critical functionalities:

* There are **no calculations of estimated times of arrival/pick-ups** available
* Advanced optimization is **charged extra**
* You have to download and install several different apps instead of having one platform and one dedicated drivers’ app for simplicity and easier navigation
* **No features that ensure recipient satisfaction**, as there are no notifications informing them of their delivery status, location, or ETA. That means you’d have to find another platform to take care of this area if you’re dealing with comprehensive last-mile delivery management
* **Low customisation options** - there isn’t much you can change or adjust about the software
* It **lacks vital operational parameters** - e.g., you cannot automatically match a particular load with a vehicle with all the right requirements (refrigeration, size, etc.) or the most skilled drivers with more challenging tasks. You have to do that manually, which is extremely time-consuming, especially if you manage a larger fleet
* OnTime 360 **isn’t optimized for working on Macs** - it needs to be adjusted further by using virtualization software to function well. Consequently, additional software fees for the virtualization software and operating system may apply
* There are **no live-chat options** available in any plan - the only way couriers and drivers can communicate with dispatchers is via SMS and email

That means that OnTime 360 has a pretty limited scope of possible use cases, as we’ll shortly see.

## OnTime 360 Reviews - How much does OnTime 360 cost?

As far as OnTime 360’s price is concerned, this platform looks really affordable at first glance.

![OnTime 360 Pricing](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-pricing.png "OnTime 360 Pricing")

Its starter, Essential plan, comes at only $39 per month, whereas Enterprise Plus, the highest tier, comes at $349 per month.

However, these are only starting prices.

Namely, there’s **an additional $99 fee for account activation** that’s paid one-off.

Moreover, **each plan has a limited number of users**, whereas each additional user is charged **an additional $19**.

The **number of API transactions you get in a plan is also limited,** meaning that every extra 1000 transactions will be charged a $1.

Finally, if you want actual route optimization included in your plan rather than just having mere distance calculation, you’ll have to pay more - from **$0.15 to $0.33 per optimization**.

With OnTime 360, costs seem to just keep stacking up.

### The verdict

OnTime 360 only looks like a budget-friendly option, but it’s anything but.

Its initial plans pricing omits things like:

* Activation fees
* Extra users - and once you consider that even the highest-tier plan includes only 18 users, it’s clear you’ll have to pay up no matter what plan you choose. The number of included users is way too small in each package
* Route optimization
* Additional API transactions

That makes OnTime 360 a **viable option only for smaller businesses with modest needs** for delivery management that can get by without the more advanced options.

## Who should use OnTime 360?

Once you consider its pricing and its core functionality, the conclusion is simple.

Businesses that only deal with **courier and messenger services**, that have **smaller fleets** and **don’t necessarily need more advanced features** could do quite well with OnTime 360.

However, medium and larger businesses looking for an all-around delivery management solution won’t see much benefit from using this platform.

## OnTime 360 Reviews - The bottom line

It’s safe to say that OnTime 360 has some features that make it an attractive solution for couriers and similar transportation services focusing on shipments.

Moreover, OnTime 360 enables such businesses to give their customers more control over their shipments by offering better visibility of each order and customisation options via the Customer Web Portal.
