Let’s dive in.

## Delivery Performance Basics

How your delivery teams perform their tasks speaks volumes about your company.

But what is the definition of delivery performance?

And what affects the performance of your fleet?

In this first part, we cover the basics and reveal the role performance plays in fulfillment.

Here's what you need to know:

### What Is Delivery Performance?

At its core, **delivery performance** is the effectiveness of your organization to fulfill order requests and provide products or services to customers. How well you perform these activities depends on your teams’ ability to complete tasks according to terms of delivery and within your operational capacity.

These limits include the resources, structures, and technology you have at your disposal to keep running the various delivery processes involved in order fulfillment.

So, the only way to raise capacity without expanding is to optimize delivery performance. And in doing so, improve your effectiveness to deliver goods or services to customers.

### What Affects Delivery Performance?

There are four main factors that affect delivery performance. These are:

* **Supply chain management.** Forecasting demand to determine the frequency at which you source products and ensure an uninterrupted supply of products to your customers.

* **Inventory management.** Managing the number of products you have available for sale and delivery to customers at any given time.

* **In-full and on-time delivery.** When a customer places an order, it is crucial that you deliver the items in full quantity and within the expected timeframe.

* **Transportation requirements**. Keeping track of all aspects of transportation such as delivery range, driver and vehicle availability is key for boosting delivery performance.

### Why Is It Important to Measure Delivery Performance?

Delivery, like any other service, needs to improve to make your business stay competitive on the market.

To improve the processes, you’ll first need to evaluate the current performance. This means calculating [**key metrics in delivery logistics**](https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/).

Measuring **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** in delivery gives you inisght into the state of your operations based on data.

Evaluating and regularly tracking KPIs also paints an accurate picture of the strengths and weaknesses of your delivery.

In turn, that helps you to uncover wasteful processes and errors in your performance. But also find opportunities for improvement, which can lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness.

In fact, companies that optimize supply chains have [**15% lower delivery costs**](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-statistics-2020/) than companies that don’t.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, since using data and monitoring KPIs also helps you to:

* Continuously deliver operational excellence
* Raise customer experience and satisfaction
* [**Use delivery tactics to grow your business**](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-tactics-to-grow-operations/)

## Delivery KPIs You Need to Track

The only way to evaluate, monitor, and optimize delivery performance is to calculate KPIs.

But there are a lot of delivery performance metrics you can use to do this.

So in this part, we give you seven examples of delivery KPIs.

These indicators will be the first step in your performance evaluation.

And the base data you can use to enhance your delivery operations.

Let’s take a look:

### #1 Number of Completed Deliveries

One of the main key performance metrics in logistics is the **total number of completed deliveries**.

This normally refers to the sum of all your product deliveries per month, quarter, or year.

Although it may seem obvious, the total number of deliveries is actually one of the key metrics that are used to measure other performance values.

It is the core value that helps determine the overall effectiveness of delivery performance.

For example, companies can use it to calculate the average number of deliveries, which helps them identify growth potential.

If the figure is further broken down into different categories such as product types, locations, etc. it will also help you optimize other important delivery metrics.

### #2 Order Accuracy

[**Order accuracy**](https://elogii.com/blog/order-accuracy/), also called the perfect order measurement, is the percentage of orders that were delivered without any errors, compared to the total number of orders.

Order accuracy helps you spot mistakes that occur during the delivery process, e.g. returned or damaged products, failed deliveries, or orders placed by mistake.

Since errors can occur at any point during the fulfillment cycle, the order accuracy rate is not easy to calculate.

One way to improve that is to make it easier to submit reports every step of the way. This can be done with the help of advanced [**last-mile delivery solutions**](https://elogii.com/blog/last-mile-delivery-solutions/).

### #3 On-Time Delivery

**On-time delivery** is a metric that tracks the percentage (or the number) of orders fulfilled within the expected delivery date.

This is one of the most important KPIs because it improves your customer experience, customer relationship, and retention.

According to a [**study done by Oracle**](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/returns-in-store-experiences-101519.html), **13% of customers** will not repeat the purchase if the order was not delivered on time.

Delays can be caused by a number of reasons such as:

* Wrong forecasts
* Order errors
* Inventory issues
* Supplier delays
* Late pickup
* Delivery schedules
* And more

Figuring out which orders were delivered late can help companies find and resolve the source of the problem.

### #4 Average Time Per Delivery

**Average time per delivery**, also called the average service time metric, refers to the average time required to complete a delivery over a period of time (day, month, quarter, or year).

This metric helps you determine the efficiency of your planned delivery routes and the overall effectiveness of the supply chain.

Knowing the average time and offering precise information on delivery time can have a positive impact on customer experience. But, at the same time, improve the accuracy rate of picking up orders, and [**reduce the number of returns**](https://elogii.com/blog/reverse-logistics-and-ecommerce-returns/).

Comparing different average delivery times across equal time periods can help you see where the process can be optimized and improved.

### #5 Average Cost of Delivery

Calculating the **average cost of delivery** is done based on specific key parameters such as distance, vehicle, and product type.

When you divide the sum of the vehicle, driver, fuel and other costs by the total distance, you will get the average cost based on the distance.

If you calculate based on the product or vehicle parameter, you need to divide the sum of the vehicle cost (for a specific product), driver cost, and fuel cost by the total number of deliveries.

Knowing the value of the average cost of delivery can help you make operational changes that will reduce the cost without damaging the performance.

For example, you can invest in better quality vehicles, or tools like [**route optimization software**](https://elogii.com/blog/guide-to-route-optimization-software/).

### #6 Transit Time to Distance

**Transit time to distance** refers to the time that drivers and couriers spend in transportation from the pick-up location to the drop-off.

It compares the distance that a package travels to the time it takes it to move from pick-up to final destination.

Calculating this metric offers insight into delivery speed and the efficiency of the delivery routes they use. That can lead to a higher order accuracy rate and reduce the number of returns.

Once you get a clear view of the average transit time, you can also provide customers with more precise [**estimated times of arrival (ETAs)**](https://elogii.com/blog/estimated-time-of-arrival-eta/).

### #7 Vehicle Capacity Utilization

**The** **vehicle capacity utilization KPI** compares the capacity of a vehicle that is used to deliver products to its total capacity.

By dividing the available capacity with the total capacity, you will get the amount of idle space that is not used for order delivery.

Calculating your vehicle capacity utilization and applying it across the fleet will show you the current profitability of delivery operations. It will also aid [**vehicle routing and scheduling**](https://elogii.com/blog/vehicle-routing-and-scheduling-in-logistics/).

If the vehicle capacity has high availability, it means that there are inefficiencies during the loading process. Or that there is room to merge some delivery routes.

In case of a low, or negative availability, the current vehicle fleet is insufficient and should be expanded.

## How Do You Measure Delivery Performance?

With the global reach of technology advancement, measuring delivery performance is another process that is assisted with modern software and tools.

### What Tools Do You Need to Measure Delivery KPIs?

There are different types of supply chain management tools that can help you streamline logistic processes and measure delivery KPIs. These tools belong to the following categories:

* Distribution networks
* Vehicle maintenance
* And more

It can help reduce transportation costs while keeping the high quality of delivery.

### #2 Raise Delivery Speed

[**Delivery speed**](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-speed/) is vital for every online business and has a huge impact on the customer satisfaction rate.

At least [**34% of consumers**](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-statistics-2020/) would rather shop in physical stores than online because of long delivery times.

Diligently measuring KPIs can give you insight into the productivity of your entire delivery fleet.

After analyzing different types of data related to the delivery process, you will be able to determine which corrections to make to achieve faster delivery times.

The right data can help you raise the delivery speed by optimizing delivery routes, merging reverse and forward logistics, setting order priorities, adjusting routes in real-time, and more.

### #3 Improve Customer Experience

An incredible [**86% of customers**](https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/) would be willing to pay more to buy products and services from companies with great customer experience.

Monitoring KPIs that affect customer satisfaction and performing actions based on the data gathered is the first step to forming a customer-centric supply chain.

Some of the key KPIs that can help this goal are on-time delivery, average delivery time, delivery accuracy, perfect order management, inventory management, return rate, etc.

Maximizing your customer satisfaction rate leads to more repeat orders, stronger customer loyalty, and even the growth of your customer base, which further leads to increased revenue.

### #4 Plan Better Schedules and Routes

Monitoring carefully selected KPIs allows you to gather data on different aspects of route management such as planned vs. actual performance (the distance driven, number of stops, time at each stop, etc.), safety-related metrics, compliance-related metrics, cost metrics (cost per mile, engine idle time, revenue per station, etc.), and more.

All this fleet performance information can be used to [**plan better delivery schedules**](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-plan-better-delivery-schedules/) and routes.

To maximize your future route performance, you should take into consideration the data coming from three different levels: dispatchers and drivers, logistic executives, and C-suite executives.

### #5 Easily Scale Operations

[**Scaling delivery logistics**](https://elogii.com/blog/map-routing-software/) is essential for competitiveness in today’s market.

Companies constantly compete to provide more flexible and faster delivery options.

Investing time in KPI analysis offers valuable insights on how to stay ahead of the competition.

It also offers attractive new shipping options such as [**same-day delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-offer-same-day-delivery-using-delivery-management-software/), without disrupting the quality of delivery operations.

Analyzing metrics such as average delivery time, on-time delivery, order accuracy, and many others offers data necessary to scale efficiently.

Choosing the right KPIs allows you to painlessly grow and expand your offer with the help of data-based projections.

### #6 Build an Agile Delivery

[**Building an agile delivery operation**](https://elogii.com/blog/agile-delivery-operations/) is a modern procedure that lets companies adapt to changes and increase the efficiency of their activities.

[**According to McKinsey**](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization), agile operations are used by only **4% of companies**, while **37% of companies** started implementing the process.

Implementing agility requires access to key performance information. Closely monitoring your main KPIs helps to plan the deliveries on the go, improve the speed of delivery, and raise the level of performance.

Being on the frontline of exciting new procedures that improve the overall logistics efficiency can provide you with a significant competitive advantage.

### #7 Continuous Improvement

The use of KPIs is the most efficient way to measure the overall success of an organization and to spot opportunities for improvement.

Continuous improvement is crucial for the success of any business. In this context, KPIs are used to define the actions needed to achieve improvement goals.

They also help you determine whether a potential change will have a positive or negative impact.

When KPIs are carefully chosen and regularly analyzed, companies get a chance to raise the standards of their delivery performance.
