## Digital Waybill vs. Onfleet – Ease of use

### Digital Waybill

The UI of Digital Waybill is very straightforward. It has a clean, simplistic design that's easy to pick up and operate.

Digital Waybill – Dispatcher

It’s seamless to set up the mobile phone tracking and dispatching systems, and the mobile app is convenient for drivers to use on the move.

Digital Waybill also keeps track of customer payments, both received and sent, so that consumers can easily access past bills as needed.

### Onfleet

Onfleet has a clean and easy-to-use UI. The interface is straightforward, with drag-and-drop options.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9XkIJDtNm7ycjZD73bjuaKfOhVHynPTSGzc7JshMqybzZNlgfwl-o6w4pWdmok6yYfZViRYbP93r3hIF9cje7i-XGFFuMIyn_FwZlnqmr1it17rB_CIzs7ij5nUziQt4CGV2RI7V05ZCdQtLRaUsykJPo2vZkoYNuauHPv4Nwo8QMlC8f0m0Wj7rRMcKEQ =624x353)

Onfleet – UI

As Onfleet's driver apps are available on both Android and iOS devices, onboarding and educating new drivers is a breeze.

When assignments have been imported, loads are automatically allocated to the most suitable drivers based on their availability and current location. This reduces time and labor costs.

Some Onfleet users, however, have complained about the [reliability of customer alerts](https://www.g2.com/products/onfleet/reviews/onfleet-review-5186918), noting that alerts are occasionally missed.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JXjgR43xZpmceR1j9VdMzny_VtIryI_bdf5ijDzmkSUDR1Oz4-mb5vqBXk2JN0HZdq_StgfDzZTyvqfeb78hSXFo7DcOVSPylK_dqcIjGSnPzCrNQAiV-xRKyxetpm5QStRvjuWT5CvHSYM96hpOZAP-t-xFRYZ5l7iNh_53YLRMGzvZkeGbdVwcnnEog =624x247)

Onfleet – A review about the reliability of customer alerts

One [client also complained](https://www.softwareadvice.com/fleet-management/onfleet-profile/reviews/) about the software's slow speed and glitches, which are especially problematic when managing numerous orders. According to the customer, the system may get sluggish when many jobs are waiting in line.

Occasionally, it will only assign the pickup job to a driver while leaving the corresponding delivery job unassigned.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9RoGdHbJ2iDayNlMJg-D7Ebs-9hBgzGjbK7UoBXYDa0BOyWuHJOX-tVLGBPJXU4SyfsHQMbuFKYzoNhnddp6PZptDndAcRYyu1z05yNCnxtpLxfjlnr-Jh_iBkYXYOOJkY6tYCtA_eS7Tzlf7aCYrXGsSPVbR-UzJy6mZhsYqQNEvPwcEkkatPCMFaym9A =624x267)

Onfleet – A review about speed and bugs

### The verdict

Digital Waybill and Onfleet’s delivery and transport management systems are both easy to master and have an intuitive UI. The onboarding procedure for Digital Waybill and Onfleet is straightforward.

While Onfleet’s software is certainly impressive, its occasional freezes, missed customer notifications, and bugs hamper the quality of the delivery process – especially when you are short on time.

So, Digital Waybill wins in this category.

## Digital Waybill vs. Onfleet – Key features

### Digital Waybill

Digital Waybill has the following key features:

* **Dispatch management system – You can track drivers via GPS, create smart routes, create orders automatically, set up recurring orders, and add a company logo and address. You can also monitor your fleet and drivers live with a map-based dashboard.**

* **Real-time tracking –** You can use GPS tracking devices to track your drivers. You can also instantly communicate order specifics to fleet drivers, streamline their operations, and monitor their status.

* **Proof of Delivery (POD) –** Customers can check their item’s delivery status and receive POD instantly via any web-enabled device. Drivers can collect digital signatures and upload these as PODs. With Digital Waybill, sending and storing POD data in the cloud is done automatically. This data can be used for customer complaints and disputes.

* **Customer signatures – As the app has digital signature capabilities, drivers can save space and weight by not having to transport a separate device to collect signatures.**

* **Route optimization – The software provides drivers with a continually updated, traffic-optimized route. Drivers can reroute around congested areas. This allows them to complete their deliveries quickly.**

One drawback of Digital Waybill is that the route manager is not included in the basic plan but is instead reserved for more expensive packages. Any modern delivery management solution should have route optimization, as its absence compromises service quality.

* **Invoice management – Digital Waybill creates invoices for customers automatically.**

* **Flexible pricing – Pricing depends on map zones, package types, distance, and weight.**

### Onfleet

Onfleet has the following key features:

* **Customizable dashboards – Onfleet's customizable reports and dashboards allow users to keep tabs on all the latest developments of their orders and drivers. Users can communicate with their drivers and discuss upcoming assignments.**

* **Route optimization – Onfleet calculates the optimal delivery route by factoring in time, location, truck capacity, and traffic. When there is an upgrade, drivers are notified immediately via text message.**

* **Auto-dispatching – By automating the process of dispatching fleets along specified routes, Onfleet helps businesses save time and money while lowering the number of drivers required to complete delivery tasks.**

* **PODs – Drivers can use the Onfleet app on their smartphones to submit electronic paperwork. Onfleet can capture images, signatures, barcodes, and notes. While Onfleet’s more expensive plans contain convenient extras like age verification and barcode scanning, cheaper plans don’t.**

* **Predictive ETAs – Using machine learning, Onfleet can provide notifications and precise arrival time estimates. Customers are alerted via SMS whenever a predefined event occurs, and they also receive ETA updates for their goods (for example, when a delivery process is initiated, when a driver arrives, when a driver is done, etc.)**

Onfleet, however, doesn’t support sending email alerts. You can only send text messages (and these cost extra).

* **Real-time tracking – Onfleet offers fleet tracking, allowing administrators and dispatchers to keep tabs on drivers with ease.**

* **Last-mile reporting – Onfleet allows you to monitor metrics such as completion rates, on-time performance, servicing times, customer satisfaction ratings, mileage, and more. You can easily generate reports and export data to other programs.**

* **Customer feedback – Onfleet provides a first-hand account of each customer's experience following delivery through its integrated feedback form and an encrypted private chat platform with drivers.**

### The verdict

The capabilities of Digital Waybill and Onfleet are comparable (including driver management, customer signatures, and POD collection.).

However, Onfleet's robust customer feedback capabilities give it an edge over Digital Waybill, which has less detailed customer feedback capabilities.

In addition, the most basic plans don’t come with route optimization – a crucial feature of any up-to-date distribution management system. This is a major downside of Digital Waybill.

Since Digital Waybill's lesser plans lack route optimization, they may not appeal to companies that place a premium on in-depth route optimization.

## Digital Waybill vs. Onfleet – Integrations and API

### Digital Waybill

You can easily integrate Digital Waybill with QuickBooks. Invoices can be made with a single click, and there is no need to import or export files, thanks to Quickbooks' seamless connectivity.

Digital Waybill also works well with Intuit and CXT.

### Onfleet

You can easily establish, migrate, or manage operations across many channels with the help of Onfleet's integrations. Onfleet integrates with a wide range of third-party systems, including Slack, Salesforce, Google Sheets, and other eCommerce platforms.

The Zapier connection is very helpful as well. With Zapier, companies without a development team can make connections, push deliveries, and trigger notifications.

### The verdict

Digital Waybill and Onfleet have great integration capabilities.

Digital Waybill's strength is in its compatibility with Quickbooks, while Onfleet's strength lies in its Zapier integration. However, Onfleet integrates with a greater variety of third-party applications than Digital Waybill does.

Onfleet wins.

## Digital Waybill vs. Onfleet – Pricing

### Digital Waybill

Digital Waybill offers different price ranges. There are no hidden fees or long-term commitments, and you can change your plan at any time.

* **Unlimited:** $309 per month

This plan includes unlimited drivers, technical support, and unlimited online and telephone orders.

* **Ultimate: $439 per month**

This plan includes the mobile dispatch app, unlimited drivers, technical support, and unlimited online and telephone orders.

### Onfleet

Onfleet – Pricing

Onfleet offers three pricing tiers:

* **Launch:** $500 a month with 2000 tasks

With this plan, you can use features like API integrations with billing and invoicing systems, route optimization, and driver chat between drivers and dispatchers.

* **Scale**: $1150 a month with 5000 tasks

With this plan, you can scan barcodes at both the point of delivery and pickup. In addition, drivers can get unique phone numbers that clients can use to get in touch with them. This package also includes a dedicated support agent and expedited email responses.

* **Enterprise**: This comes at a custom price based on your company's needs.

This pricing tier includes every feature on the "Scale plan," complete access to driver analytics data, and more.

### The verdict

Since all Digital Waybill plans include an unlimited number of users, it is more cost-effective than Onfleet. Onfleet’s pricing still depends on the number of jobs (i.e., deliveries or pickups) you get each month.

The premium plans offered by Onfleet are also best suited for businesses with significant fleet sizes. It's not cost-effective if you only have three or four drivers.

If you choose a less expensive Onfleet plan, you can count on mediocre service that won't impress your clients. For instance, the lack of a vital component of modern delivery management: barcode scanning.

Digital Waybill, on the other hand, is less expensive than Onfleet. It's economical for small to medium-sized businesses. However, you won't get access to the route optimization feature if you opt for a basic plan.

## Digital Waybill vs. Onfleet – Use cases

### Digital Waybill

Digital Waybill caters to and suits the needs of small courier companies, messenger firms, or small trucking and transportation companies.

### Onfleet

Onfleet is best suited for small to medium-sized businesses that don’t require a high volume of monthly operations and can get by without more advanced delivery optimization tools.

Smaller firms who outsource some of their deliveries and need the option to subcontract to other enterprises might also find it helpful.

### The verdict

Digital Waybill and Onfleet are great for small and medium-sized businesses.

However, large-scale businesses and companies should opt for eLogii since it provides more in-depth features and detailed package tracking.

## Digital Waybill vs. Onfleet – Customer service and trainings

### Digital Waybill

Digital Waybill's dedication to its customers is one of the company's greatest qualities. They have great 24/7 online support.

Customer support can help you with everything from installing the program on your computer to configuring the smartphones you and your drivers use to answering any questions that may arise.

The team also organizes regular training sessions and webinars to provide you with everything you need to use the software.

### Onfleet

When urgent issues arise, Onfleet's lack of real-time customer support can be a major setback. Onfleet's customer service is limited to email (not the most convenient method, given the delay involved in waiting for a reply).

Reviews (like the one below) show that this is a pressing issue for many customers.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kQQWdEcUmsGJG2kkyJ-5aQXkSYiBtH8M8PZ9KQk19Y9BpfsnWWM-1WzTFGgx_MyL6xSjl4pJVAhIt9cemzfw-d2_AiwgMoPoFag8oRBaI3X9PsOE18BDYvj-06__xZrj1IaKSPFwf1omTAgVAxTR-YwE95dLAVzM8pyGM2OnexMHHLzxD3FbSDYEOTf1wg =624x281)

Onfleet – A review about customer support

However, depending on your plan level, Onfleet allows you to arrange a set amount of support calls per month instead of receiving live phone help.

### The verdict

Digital Waybill has superior customer service when compared to Onfleet. Digital Waybill wins.

## Digital Waybill vs. Onfleet – Analytics and Reporting

### Digital Waybill

Digital Waybill provides in-depth customer and driver records, as well as interactive reporting of driver trips and commission calculations.

With the daily off-site automatic backup feature, users never have to worry about losing data.

### Onfleet

With Onfleet, you can keep tabs on your vehicles' whereabouts constantly, as well as view reports on each driver's efficiency. With these metrics, you can have a constant, high-level overview of your drivers' activities.

Onfleet – In-app records

Success rates, on-time performance, servicing times, customer satisfaction ratings, mileage, and more can all be tracked and used to create custom reports in Onfleet.

In addition, drivers have quick and easy access to their whole task history.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NVaAK2-WLXw67G5OmnJl5a5coski_ShtZLpPcM0jlb33V6kZe44wSUzydOsfHNzsLSPa9t9AvWnhq5vpTu9UXvPvSe2Y-HXIUg3rYo5WNRIZDMrDf-LQPonIFaAmpHPlGZmu6yjFgnU_1Dt_Q4qveGxttYTrsYU5oM-Ao3zW2XRqXAQxLWYcAieN9p9JjA =624x355)

Onfleet – Reporting

### The verdict

Both tools have great analytic and reporting capabilities. However, Onfleet gives a more detailed analysis, so it wins.

## Digital Waybill vs. Onfleet vs. eLogii

The best features of a top-tier delivery management system include real-time shipment tracking, actionable information, and the guarantee that products will be delivered to clients in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Digital Waybill and Onfleet are great delivery management tools, but each has limitations.

Digital Waybill and Onfleet are better suited to small and mid-sized businesses with a low monthly activity volume and no need to manage sophisticated logistics.

If you're looking for a better alternative to these two tools, try eLogii.
