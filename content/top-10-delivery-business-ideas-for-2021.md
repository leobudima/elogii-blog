Let’s dive right in.

## #1 Food Delivery

There were [**1,231.9 million**](https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/100/online-food-delivery/worldwide) food delivery users in the world in 2020.

Yes, this fact is mindblowing and we're starting our list with one of the most popular delivery business ideas known as food delivery.

The food delivery business has definitely overtaken e-commerce in certain markets. In fact, the global online food delivery is expected to reach [**$192.16**](https://www.reportlinker.com/p06064489/Online-Food-Delivery-Services-Global-Market-Report-COVID-19-Growth-And-Change-To.html?utm_source=GNW) billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 11%.

The growth is mainly due to the companies continuing their operations and adapting to the new normal while recovering from the COVID-19 impact.

Another reason for food being the top delivery business is the fact that

that people either don't have time to cook every day or they just don't like it.

It's simply far more convenient to get your favorite food delivered to your doorstep.

In case you were not sure about it, [**starting a food delivery business **](https://elogii.com/blog/food-delivery/)is a very good idea.

### How to start with a food delivery business?

There are various ways you can jump into a food delivery business.

You can choose to sell your food or you can work with restaurants and get them to post their offerings on your ordering app.

No matter whether you choose to manage a food marketplace or to prepare food, the first thing you need to do after doing market research is to plan your logistics.

You need to:

* Map your territory
* Choose your fleet
* Be aware if you need reverse logistics
* [**Know how to choose delivery driver app**](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-choose-delivery-driver-app/)

All of these things are important.

Because without the right logistics plan you won't be able to deliver in time, which is a top priority in this business.

## #2 Grocery Delivery

Just like food, the grocery delivery business is another popular delivery vertical that has become very popular in the last two years.

COVID 19 played a huge role in the increase in the demand for grocery delivery.

Once a luxury, the coronavirus pandemic has transformed grocery delivery services into something not only popular but also affordable.

In fact, in the USA, according to Coresight, online grocery sales grew [**40% in 2020**](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/online-grocery-sales-grow-40-2020#:\~:text=Russell%20Redman%201%20%7C%20May%2011%2C%202020%20U.S.,the%20Coresight%20Research%20U.S.%20Online%20Grocery%20Survey%202020.)**.**

After what we have been through in the past two years, it's safe to say that grocery delivery is here to stay.

### How to start a grocery delivery business?

Here comes the best part, you can start a grocery business without much effort as long as you are provided with the software and tools.

Keep in mind that, unlike e-commerce where the delivery time can be more than a day, your grocery delivery business needs to be able to finish deliveries within the same day.

This means you need a well-organized delivery system and more reliable coordination while assigning orders to delivery agents.

This is not possible without the help of [**grocery delivery software,** ](https://elogii.com/blog/grocery-delivery-software/)because it lets you handle all tasks from when you receive an order to when you deliver it to the customer.

## #3 Beverage and Alcohol Delivery

The pandemic has forced wineries, breweries, restaurants, and shops to look for new ways to reach consumers, such as apps that deliver alcohol and beverages.

Worldwide, retail stores that sell alcohol turned to [**curbside pickup**](https://elogii.com/blog/curbside-pickup-and-delivery/) and **home delivery** for the solution.

Buying alcohol and other beverages online became the _New Normal_.

In fact, online alcohol sales in 2020 went up by **243%,** according to [**research from Nielsen**](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-drinking-alcohol-sales/).

Alcohol delivery business, as well as beverage delivery business, became particularly popular in metropolitan cities.

People love the convenience and the comfort of having their preferred alcohol or a beverage delivered to their doorstep.

### How to start a beverage and alcohol delivery business?

Like most other delivery businesses, your alcohol and beverage delivery business needs to have reliable suppliers you can count on.

Apart from the good quality of your drinks, you need to put together a reliable delivery fleet and get them to buy and deliver beverages and alcohol according to the orders received.

That's why it's crucial to [**optimize your alcohol delivery business**.](https://elogii.com/blog/alcohol-delivery/)

Another important factor when setting up an alcohol delivery business is the licensing involved. That's why before you start an alcohol delivery business be sure you have a license for it.

## #4 Pickup and Delivery

Convenience, convenience, convenience!

In today's economy, this is what people want the most. They are also willing to pay a fee for pickup and delivery services.

Most people are living busy lives and being able to get their pick up and delivery tasks handled by someone else is a huge plus.

From things you need picking up from a particular store to getting a gift delivered to your friend’s house on their special day, **pickup and delivery business became a norm.**

The pickup and delivery business operates within the city limits, so if you live in a smaller city, we can even call it [**local delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/local-delivery/)**.**

So, if your goal is to rack up sales and generate more profit, this is the way to do it.

### How to start a pick-up and delivery business?

Starting a pick-up and delivery service is easier than a food or grocery delivery business because you **don't need any physical objects to deliver to your customers**.

What you need is an exceptional delivery fleet with reliable and professional agents.

## #5 Courier Delivery

**Courier delivery business,** unlike pickup and delivery business, operates between different cities and states, which can be quite challenging.

That's why for a package delivery business you need to be equipped well for this kind of business and to be aware that you will need a considerable amount of money to start this business going.

### How to start a courier delivery business?

We're not going to lie, it's not going to be easy.

First of all, you need to invest in big vehicles that can store large quantities of goods like trucks and minivans.

Also, keep in mind that with the bigger investment comes higher profit margins, especially if you expand your service area considerably and start dealing in multiple orders.

## #6 3PL and 4PL

[**Logistics** ](https://elogii.com/blog/vehicle-routing-and-scheduling-in-logistics/)is a vast business vertical that literally covers everything from inbound and outbound transportation to warehousing, fleet management, and order fulfillment.

Precisely, **3PL** involves a manufacturer managing oversight of their supply chain but outsourcing their transportation and logistics operations to a 3PL provider.

On the other hand, [**4PL **](https://elogii.com/blog/4pl-guide/)providers supervise the organization and management of a whole supply chain for manufacturers and wholesalers.

Anyhow, your logistics business involves the delivery of raw materials, supplies, and finished products to other businesses.

### How to start with a logistics business?

No matter whether we’re talking about delivery for small business or a large one the scale of a logistics business is considerably larger than the delivery business ideas listed above no matter whether we’re talking about delivery for small business or a large one.

You will need a lot of things to start this business, but the priorities are:

1. **The proper team of support staff**
2. **The right delivery management software**
3. **Trucks and other large vehicles**

Even though a logistics business does require far more investment and energy on your part, the amount of money you could potentially earn is also much higher than some of the other delivery business ideas.

## #7 Pharmacy Delivery

The pharmacy delivery business is definitely an idea that picked up pace during the COVID- 19 pandemic.

In November 2020, [**Amazon announced a new program**](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-starts-selling-prescription-medication-in-us-2020-11?_ga=2.66925612.383827597.1628770684-371301074.1628770684) to fill prescriptions and deliver them right to your door.

It's pretty clear that after Amazon doing this, **pharmacy delivery is here to stay**.

### How to Start Pharmacy Delivery?

Similar to food delivery, there are two ways you can go about setting up your pharmacy delivery business.

The first involves tying up with offline pharmacies and placing their products on your app and website.

Once an order comes through, you transmit it to the nearest partner pharmacy and use your delivery fleet to complete the order.

The second method involves working with a medicine supplier, maintaining a regular medicine inventory, and fulfilling each order yourself.

No matter the way you choose to go with you’ll need a dominant marketplace builder to launch your website and app.

## #8 Construction Delivery

Without reliable, on-time construction material delivery there's no profitability on any construction project.

In the construction industry, every project is meticulously planned out and resources designated to give construction firms the best possible chance of comfortably meeting their deadline.

For maximum efficiency, many companies turn to construction couriers to guarantee that materials and equipment arrive perfectly on time.

This is why the **construction delivery business** is a demanding but profitable business idea.

### How to start a construction delivery service?

First of all, you need to understand the nature of the building and construction industry which means you understand the tight deadlines you will need to meet.

That's why having the right equipment and tools is essential for this job.

You have to be able to safely and securely deliver large, heavy bulk orders, and probably you will need trucks that can be tailored for each individual delivery.

For instance, [**using delivery management software in construction**](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-management-software-for-construction/) can help you manage:

* Transportation
* Structures
* Operations
* Customers
* Data

## # 9 Furniture Delivery and Assembly

One of the booming industries is without any doubt a **furniture delivery business.** One of the reasons for that is the fact that COVID-19 made staying at home no longer an option but a compulsion.

Hence, the demand for varied and multi-functional furniture products is consistently increasing. It has actually been projected that the online furniture market size will [**grow by $84.26 billion during 2020-2024**.](https://www.technavio.com/report/online-furniture-market-industry-analysis?utm_source=pressrelease&utm_medium=bw&utm_campaign=New_bw4_v8_week46&utm_content=IRTNTR40655)

### How to Start a furniture delivery business?

The fastest and the easiest way is to partner with a reliable furniture supplier.

Finding the right supplier is crucial to be successful since when it comes to furniture, the quality matters more than the delivery timeliness.

Still, don't forget how important it is to put your delivery fleer together and launch an online furniture marketplace.

One thing you can do in order to make your business stand out amongst the rest is to add furniture assembly to your delivery services.

You should also think about offering [**white glove delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/white-glove-delivery/) to your customers and ensure that your items arrive in prime condition.

## #10 E-Commerce and Retail

E-commerce and **retail delivery business** are among the earliest and most popular delivery business ideas.

It's quite simple, you either partner with multiple vendors and just handle the delivery part of the business, or you both sell and deliver your products.

### How to start an e-commerce and retail business?

Probably the best idea is to start with a particular category of products and once you start getting the regular business you can add more categories to it.

There are many decisions you need to take when setting up an e-commerce delivery business including:

* The kind of products you sell
* Price
* The delivery process
* Delivery guarantee
