Let’s get started.

## Grocery Delivery Software 101

In this part of the post, we’re going to introduce you to the basics of grocery delivery software.

You’ll see:

* What it is and how it works;
* What makes it different;
* Why do you need it;

And how grocery delivery software can help you overcome the challenges brought up by the COVID-19 pandemic.

### What is grocery delivery software?

**Grocery delivery software** is a logistical tool designed to help you automatically manage delivery activities, such as scheduling pick-ups and drop-offs, planning routes, dispatching drivers, and tracking progress across operations.

It's called grocery delivery software because it lets you handle all tasks from when you receive an order to when you deliver it to the customer.

That includes:

* Creating tasks and schedules;
* Planning and optimizing routes;
* Assigning orders to drivers;
* Dispatching drivers;
* Tracking progress;
* Notifying customers;
* Collecting feedback;
* And more.

### How does grocery delivery software work?

Grocery delivery software is a complex system.

It has multiple modules for handling different desired actions.

For example, one module is responsible for planning routes, while another for tracking your driver on those routes.

Each module relies on its own set of codes and algorithms to perform these operations. 

And all of them integrate to a centralized system - **the grocery delivery platform**.

> Read this post to know whether [**to centralize or not to centralize delivery operations.**](https://elogii.com/blog/to-centralize-or-not-to-centralize-delivery/ "to centralize or not to centralize delivery operations")

  
You see (and use) the platform via its two main components:

* The dashboard
* The driver app

**The dashboard** is the central control panel. From there, you have full use of all of the modules and a real-time view of the operation.

For example, you can assign tasks to drivers. Or dispatch drivers to a customer location. Or see where your drivers are on the map.

**The driver app** is a mobile version ([**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elogii.delivery.mobile&hl=en&gl=US "driver app for android") or [**iOS**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elogii-driver/id1481789574 "driver app for ios")) of the software. It gives access to vital data and functions to drivers which they need to perform tasks in the field.

For example, a driver can see where his future drop-offs are going to be. Or view the name of his next customer. Or collect the [**electronic proof of delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/electronic-proof-of-delivery-epod-how-does-it-improve-logistics-operations/ "electronic proof of delivery").

So with grocery delivery software, there’s ONE tool for managing the entire delivery.

And that’s what makes it unique.

### How is grocery delivery software different from other solutions?

Grocery delivery software is an end-to-end solution.

It can connect to other vital tools that you use:

* Online grocery store;
* Order management system;
* Inventory managing software;
* And others.

That is possible, thanks to API integration. (But more on that later)

So like we’ve just mentioned, all you need is one tool to manage the entire supply chain.

### Why does grocery delivery software work so well for business?

Unlike legacy systems, grocery delivery software works on the cloud.

Besides the many benefits of this, [**adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics**](https://elogii.com/blog/adopting-the-cloud-first-approach-to-delivery-logistics/ "adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics") enables you to:

* Gain real-time visibility;
* Build an agile delivery;
* Take a holistic approach to logistics, and;
* Scale as you grow.

Here's our pick of the top [**delivery tactics to grow your operations**](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-tactics-to-grow-operations/ "delivery tactics to grow your operations").

  
It's easier to stay on top of what's going on, regardless of size, scale, and order volumes.

##   
Who can use grocery delivery software?

In the second part of the article, we’ll turn our attention to you - the user.

Here, you’ll find out whether grocery delivery software is the right tool for your business.

Specifically, you’ll see whether the system can match your needs. And the nature of your grocery delivery.

Let’s jump right in.

### For online grocery shopping

**Online grocery shopping** isn’t a new invention.

But COVID-19 and social distancing have prompted more stores to rethink their approach and move their offer online.

If you own an online grocery store, then you rely a lot on delivery.

But you also know that it’s not your main sales offer. (Groceries are)

So, it’s vital for you to keep delivery costs down. But also provide the best service to customers.

(More on the benefits of grocery delivery software later)

### For a standalone (single) grocery store

If you have **a single bricks and mortar grocery store**, you might overlook the benefits of the software.

But the fact of the matter is that technology can help you.

You know that a lot of your regulars are buying more and more groceries from places like Amazon’s Whole Foods, Tesco, ASDA, Walmart, Sainsbury’s, and other chains.

And you know [**the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus**](https://elogii.com/blog/the-state-of-delivery-in-time-of-the-coronavirus/ "the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus") has reshaped the landscape.

In 2020, many customers have shopped online using Uber, Doordash, Postmates, Grubhub, and Glovo grocery delivery.

And it may seem like dire straits there is a solution:

The secret to know [**how to compete with Amazon delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-amazon-delivery/ "how to compete with Amazon delivery"), Walmart, GrubHub and other giants, is to co-exist with them.

But that means you’ll need to **evaluate your strengths and weaknesses and rethink the way you deliver groceries.**

Based on experience, we suggest that you focus on **the local last-mile**.

Cover the local delivery area (3-5 kilometres) near your store. But use delivery management software to increase the speed and efficiency of your operations.

### For grocery chains

Like mom-and-pop stores, it isn’t easy **grocery chains**, either.

For you, grocery delivery software isn’t a huge investment. But it still helps you raise the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your delivery.

Specifically, the software is a one-stop solution. 

So, all you need is **one tool to manage delivery at each one of your stores**.

Regardless of whether it's a regional or nationwide chain of stores, you have complete control and visibility from one central location.

### Grocery delivery software for different types of delivery

Grocery delivery software isn’t limited just to the kind of store you have. You can also use it for different purposes.

Including:

* Grocery home delivery
* Grocery curbside delivery
* Doorstep grocery delivery
* On-demand grocery delivery
* Grocery in-store pickup

  
That’s because grocery delivery software is an end-to-end solution.

Instead of focusing on one area of operations, it enables you to take a holistic approach.

You can **manage the entire life-cycle of each delivery**. (From the moment you receive an order to when a driver drops it off to the customer)

  
At the same time, you can **monitor every aspect of last-mile delivery**. (From how you source supplies to how much inventory you have to where your drivers are in the field)

Which means **you can communicate internally and externally**, such as customers and suppliers, as well as different teams inside your organization.

  
And that’s the main reason why grocery delivery software supports any offer you provide to customers.
