Let’s get started.

## Grocery Delivery Software 101

In this part of the post, we’re going to introduce you to the basics of grocery delivery software.

You’ll see:

* What it is and how it works;
* What makes it different;
* Why do you need it;

And how grocery delivery software can help you overcome the challenges brought up by the COVID-19 pandemic.

### What is grocery delivery software?

**Grocery delivery software** is a logistical tool designed to help you automatically manage delivery activities, such as scheduling pick-ups and drop-offs, planning routes, dispatching drivers, and tracking progress across operations.

It's called grocery delivery software because it lets you handle all tasks from when you receive an order to when you deliver it to the customer.

That includes:

* Creating tasks and schedules;
* Planning and optimizing routes;
* Assigning orders to drivers;
* Dispatching drivers;
* Tracking progress;
* Notifying customers;
* Collecting feedback;
* And more.

### How does grocery delivery software work?

Grocery delivery software is a complex system.

It has multiple modules for handling different desired actions.

For example, one module is responsible for planning routes, while another for tracking your driver on those routes.

Each module relies on its own set of codes and algorithms to perform these operations. And all of them integrate to a centralized system - the grocery delivery platform.

Read this post to know whether to centralize or not to centralize delivery operations.

You see (and use) the platform via its two main components:

* The dashboard
* The driver app

**The dashboard** is the central control panel. From there, you have full use of all of the modules and a real-time view of the operation.

For example, you can assign tasks to drivers. Or dispatch drivers to a customer location. Or see where your drivers are on the map.

**The driver app** is a mobile version (Android or iOS) of the software. It gives access to vital data and functions to drivers which they need to perform tasks in the field.

For example, a driver can see where his future drop-offs are going to be. Or view the name of his next customer. Or collect the electronic proof of delivery.

So with grocery delivery software, there’s ONE tool for managing the entire delivery.

And that’s what makes it unique.

### How is grocery delivery software different from other solutions?

Grocery delivery software is an end-to-end solution.

It can connect to other vital tools that you use:

* Online grocery store;
* Order management system;
* Inventory managing software;
* And others.

That is possible, thanks to API integration. (But more on that later)

So like we’ve just mentioned, all you need is one tool to manage the entire supply chain.

### Why does grocery delivery software work so well for business?

Unlike legacy systems, grocery delivery software works on the cloud.

Besides the many benefits of this, adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery management enables you to:

* Gain real-time visibility;
* Build an agile delivery;
* Take a holistic approach to logistics, and;
* Scale as you grow.

It's easier to stay on top of what's going on, regardless of size, scale, and order volumes.
