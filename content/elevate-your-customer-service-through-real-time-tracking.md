The use of modern technology is widespread in all sectors, and undoubtedly, it’s been vital in the progression of many successful businesses. From machinery to tracking systems, technology has long been the partner of innovative business owners (and that can include you).

Real-time tracking is an excellent innovation that tells fleet managers and customers where a vehicle carrying a particular package is in real-time.

Real-time tracking is typically used to elevate a business’s delivery performance while prioritizing convenience and safety. With real-time GPS tracking systems, companies can keep a close eye on their vehicles, their status, and their location while providing live assistance to their drivers.

It might surprise you to learn that this versatile [fleet management system](https://elogii.com/blog/benefits-of-fleet-management-systems/) has more benefits than just giving you more information.

That brings us to…

## How real-time tracking can help your business grow

GPS tracking systems have been around for a while, but are you aware of all its advantages and how you can utilize them as a business owner for your business’s growth?

Here’s how real-time tracking systems will help your business grow and expand:

* It helps you avoid accidents

[Fleet managers](https://elogii.com/blog/fleet-management-route-optimization/) typically need to track trucks, the products they contain, and their drivers. Tracking this information allows fleet managers to identify the safest and most strategic routes to take.

You can also reduce the risk of truck and car accidents by monitoring the state of your employees, the state of your trucks, and your drivers’ journeys via GPS.

GPS trackers are designed to show, for example, truck-accessible roads and a location’s terrain. This can help you determine what the safest and most convenient path is (something that’s often difficult when you aren’t familiar with an area).

By utilizing fleet management and GPS systems, you can also get data on your driver’s skills and routes at a glance. This will help you spot tired, distracted, or dangerous drivers so you can take them off the road before they crash.

Crashes cost businesses thousands in repairs, compensation for injuries, lost product, and the opportunity costs of having a vehicle out of commission.

* It reduces theft

According to a report by the National Insurance Crime Bureau, over [900,000 vehicles](https://www.nicb.org/news/news-releases/nicb-report-finds-vehicle-thefts-continue-skyrocket-many-areas-us) were stolen in the US in 2021. The rate of stolen vehicles increased by 6% from the previous year.

With the risks of business vehicle theft rising, installing a tracking system on your trucks provides an extra level of security that will benefit your business in the long run. You can locate your truck at any minute with real-time tracking. This will help you identify if your vehicles have ventured off-course or have been on the road for an abnormal amount of time (two common signs of theft).

Real-time access will also help you increase the chances of recovering your vehicles should one of them be stolen. Namely, you can give the police a live view of where the stolen vehicle is so they can locate it.

* It helps you save money on fuel

Fuel costs take up a huge chunk of business operating expenses.

If you have more than one vehicle, managing them with GPS tracking will provide you with an efficient tracking system that will alert you to any changes in your vehicle's behavior on the road.

Real-time tracking can help you spot:

* Longer than usual travel times
* Speeding
* Unauthorized use of your trucks
* Slow-moving roads that should be avoided
* Vehicles driving through snow, mud, and rough terrain

All these activities increase your fuel costs, so tracking them will help you cut down on your fuel costs.

* You can leverage geofencing

Another unique feature of real-time tracking is geofencing.

Geofencing allows you to limit the parameters of your truck’s journey with GPS trackers that trigger a response if a vehicle exits your pre-set travel area. Specifically, you’ll get an alert via text or email if your vehicle starts engaging in off-road transportation or is traveling to a place at an hour where it should be somewhere else.

Geofencing will not only improve your driver’s safety but will help you prevent theft and recover your vehicle if something goes wrong.

* It ensures that drivers are being truthful

It’s vital to have a transparent relationship with your drivers to ensure that the quality of your customer service is always very high. Drivers play an integral role in the customer experience – they are often a point of contact for customers.

A GPS tracking system is essential in maintaining transparency with drivers, fleet managers, and business owners. With real-time tracking, you can get accurate and unbiased information on driver productivity and behavior.

![elogii - driver app notifications](/blog/uploads/elogii-driver-app-notifications.png "elogii - driver app notifications")

Drivers can also use real-time tracking to protect themselves at work. For example, real-time tracking can prove they were delayed because of traffic or an accident.

* It can provide more accurate ETAs to customers (increasing satisfaction)

To provide excellent customer service, you need to be transparent. That means being able to provide real-time updates and information to your customers anytime.

Customers will appreciate the convenience of being able to [track the product they ordered ](https://elogii.com/blog/elogii-last-mile-tracking/)without the hassle of waiting or calling customer service.

Real-time tracking gives you the ability to produce accurate ETAs, live vehicle tracking, and dependable service. Thus, you can establish a better relationship with them and increase customer satisfaction.

* It can increase employee productivity

In a journal article in Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, it was discussed that [people perform better when they are being watched and observed](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/13/4/391/4965846?login=false#116365149).

Tracking productivity isn’t easy on the road. However, an effective way to observe your employees as they drive is through a GPS.

Aside from observing, a tracking system creates a connection between the driver and employer that allows them to work together with the goal of better performance. Drivers can, for example, set goals for themselves and use real-time monitoring to see how their progress toward that goal is going.

Real-time tracking is designed to allow businesses to leverage guided supervision and employees to understand their productivity at a deeper level.

* It can improve driver and vehicle safety

With real-time access to your driver’s whereabouts, you can easily verify their status and your vehicle’s condition as needed.

Information like how long it’s been since a car was serviced, how a vehicle’s tires are doing, if a car breaks or speeds up too frequently, and how fast a vehicle is helps you identify faulty vehicles so that you can fix them.

Being able to identify faulty vehicles will keep your drivers safer and your vehicles on the road for longer.
