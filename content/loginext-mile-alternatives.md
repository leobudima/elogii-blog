So, you tried LogiNext Mile, but it wasn’t such a good fit? Or are you still in the process of finding the right [last-mile logistics solution](https://elogii.com/blog/last-mile-delivery-logistics-solutions/) for yourself and wonder whether LogiNext Mile might be it?

Either way, we’re here to help you out.

We’ve analysed both LogiNext Mile and some of its competitors, resulting in a list of the 4 best LogiNext Mile alternatives that will help you find the right platform.

In this article, we’ll:

* Briefly review LogiNext Mile to see what it has to offer;
* Analyse each of its alternatives in-depth;
* Highlight the best use cases for every software on our list.

## TLDR

* LogiNext Mile is an enterprise-oriented delivery management platform with a clunky UI that’s unaffordable for all but the biggest businesses
* eLogii is a powerful yet easy-to-use solution with the broadest range of customisation options and versatile functionalities, which makes it a perfect choice for businesses big and small alike
* Bringg is best suited for the biggest businesses, businesses using third-party logistics providers, and businesses that want to integrate first-mile and last-mile delivery
* Route4Me lets users choose the features they need, but its per-driver pricing and lack of advanced delivery management capabilities make it a good option only for smaller businesses
* Routific is a user-friendly yet very basic platform that can be a good solution for small businesses with elementary route planning needs

## Our approach

To get the most accurate information and the best possible insight into each of these platforms, we have:

1. Interviewed several dozen past and current users of every platform;
2. Combed through customer reviews on reputable SaaS rating sites, e.g. Capterra, G2 and GetApp.

And as we’ve developed a last-mile delivery management solution, too, we know a thing or two about what each dedicated last-mile solution needs to offer its prospective users to be A-game.

And now, let’s begin!

## LogiNext Mile - Overview

_![LogiNext Mile Alternative - LogiNext UI](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-loginext-ui.png "LogiNext Mile Alternative - LogiNext UI")_

LogiNext Mile is a dedicated last-mile delivery platform that’s part of LogiNext, a larger logistics management software with several solutions in its suite.

Even though LogiNext Mile has some features that make it worth considering, the truth is that it simply isn’t everyone’s cup of tea due to several things, as we’ll shortly see.

### LogiNext Mile - Key features

LogiNext Mile has many handy features, such as:

* **Automated route optimisation** (and manual override), rerouting, and dynamic ETAs
* Real-time **customer messaging**
* Live **vehicle tracking**
* Comprehensive **POD collection** options
* **Advanced analytics**, as it generates reports on driver performance, payments, delays, and failed attempts. However, those options are only available on the Enterprise package
* **Odometer reading**

However, LogiNext has several significant downsides worth mentioning.

One of LogiNext’s biggest shortcomings is the **lack of customisation options** regarding various operational and optimization parameters.

For example, LogiNext **doesn’t enable users to automatically optimize vehicle load**, i.e., match a particular order with just the right vehicle for accommodating it or ensure that the vehicle is being used at its optimal potential.

You’ll have to do all this manually, which can get quite time-consuming when you deal with lots of different vehicles or large-capacity vehicles such as trucks.

Moreover, clients often complain that **LogiNext Mile’s UI is very complicated to use**, even for seasoned users, which can also be a deal-breaker for some.

Finally, there’s the question of price, which we’ll delve into next.

### LogiNext Mile - Pricing

The price is one of the biggest problems with LogiNext Mile - not only because it’s a pretty expensive solution but also because its pricing policy, as disclosed on their website, is quite confusing.

_![LogiNext Mile - Pricing](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-pricing.png "LogiNext Mile - Pricing")_

There are a few problems with LogiNext’s pricing.

Firstly, their pricing page says it comes at **$49 per month per resource** for the Advanced package - a resource being **one vehicle or driver**.

However, there’s a special catch. As shown above, the smallest paid-for plan is only available at a minimum of **25 resources per month,** giving an **entry price of $1,225 per month**.

But it doesn’t end there.

If you pay attention to the tiny-lettered disclaimer underneath, you’ll see there is a **“web license cost” that’s not included in that price**.

![LogiNext Mile Pricing disclaimer](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-pricing-disclaimer.JPG "LogiNext Mile Pricing disclaimer")

That means the actual entry-level price is $1,225 per month, plus whatever a web license costs.

However, further down on the [pricing page](https://www.loginextsolutions.com/pricing/mile), it says you can have as few as 5 resources on a plan.

And to make matters even more baffling, LogiNext gives different names to the three packages in the very next table (Basic, Premium, and Advanced; presumably corresponding to Free, Advanced, and Enterprise).

### Who is LogiNext Mile for?

LogiNext Mile has many versatile features, with a few omissions (e.g. vehicle load optimization), making it one of the most powerful last-mile delivery software tools available on the market.

But it comes with a price tag to match, which puts it out of reach for most smaller businesses.

So, although its per-asset pricing would make it seem a good choice for small businesses, LogiNext Mile is an entirely unsustainable solution for all but **enterprises with significant budgets and corresponding logistics demands**.

## LogiNext Mile alternative #1 - eLogii: Perfect for big and small businesses alike

eLogii is a dedicated last-mile delivery management and optimization solution.

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - eLogii UI](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-elogii-ui.JPG "LogiNext Mile Alternative - eLogii UI")

It offers an exceptionally vast range of functionality and is designed to scale easily, which makes it perfect for various types and sizes of businesses.

### How does eLogii outperform LogiNextMile?

The first thing that gives eLogii a sharp edge over LogiNext Mile - and over most other software on the market - is its massive number of configurable parameters.

That means that users get a lot of customisation options as standard. For example, you can:

* Set up custom route start and endpoints
* Match tasks to particular driver skills
* Specify driver actions on delivery and timings for those actions
* Define a hierarchy of users and territories
* Build tolerances for late/early deliveries into routing and timing
* Allow customers to change their delivery addresses or opt for BOPIS
* Easily match the right kind of vehicle with a particular load (i.e. plan loads around capacity, weight, pallet number, refrigeration availability of a given vehicle, etc.)

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - eLogii vehicle configuration](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-elogii-vehicle-configuration.JPG "LogiNext Mile Alternative - eLogii vehicle configuration")

eLogii’s flexibility and customisation options are the main factors that enable eLogii to easily accommodate the needs of businesses of all kinds and sizes.

Moreover, eLogii has an exceptionally straightforward UI designed by UX experts to be very easy to grasp. That means that even beginners won’t find eLogii challenging to navigate despite its numerous functionalities.

Finally, eLogii has all the cutting-edge functionality LogiNext Mile offers and more, including:

* **Advanced routing options** - such as **dynamic routing**, **live vehicle tracking, multi-day** and **multi-depot routing** for long-distance haulage and shared fleets, **“return to depot”** functionality for drivers to reload, **pickup-only points**, etc.

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - eLogii UI - Live tracking](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-elogii-ui-live-tracking.png "LogiNext Mile Alternative - eLogii UI - Live tracking")

* Ability to set up **workflows in case of a failed delivery** for drivers to follow (e.g. return it to depot, leave it with a neighbour, or on another designated safe location)
* **Customer notifications** - including automated notifications from **each critical stage** of the delivery process, p**recise ETAs** and their **instant live updates** in case something changes, an option for customers to live-track their orders via a web link, etc.

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - eLogii customer notifications](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-elogii-customer-notifications.JPG "LogiNext Mile Alternative - eLogii customer notifications")

* **Extensive range of** [**POD collection methods**](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-use-proof-of-delivery/), including barcode & QR code scanning, as well as cash-on-delivery confirmation

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - eLogii POD](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-elogii-pod.JPG "LogiNext Mile Alternative - eLogii POD")

**A well-documented API and webhooks** - having first-class API is crucial for enabling integration with the wider supply chain. Since eLogii’s [API and webhooks](https://api-docs.elogii.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw682TBhATEiwA9crl38-FdcvmlPsQPvzkaLG_kU23DUFytKyNn2CZXxBS7ulh6Bdoy4uGARoCR6kQAvD_BwE) are up-to-date and comprehensive, you’ll have no trouble integrating smoothly with order management, warehouse operations, and many other types of software in no time.

It’s also worth mentioning that eLogii is a much more economical option, as its pricing plans allow unlimited users and are easily adjustable to different business needs, types and sizes, as we’ll see in the next section.

### How do eLogii and LogiNext Mile compare in price?

Unlike LogiNext Mile, eLogii’s pricing is:

* Task- rather than user-based;
* Doesn’t have a one-size-fits-all approach.

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - elogii pricing](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-elogii-pricing.png "LogiNext Mile Alternative - elogii pricing")

Namely, eLogii lets you tailor every package to your bespoke needs and business configuration.

However, the typical entry-level price is around $359 per month for 2,500 tasks, which is significantly lower than LogiNext Mile’s standard offering.

Moreover, [each of eLogii’s plans](https://elogii.com/plans-and-features?utm_content=CjwKCAjwi8iXBhBeEiwAKbUofdQnjQahWiV5t2e0M0s0YABbge-xfy-c7ljN2m9iQ68lAqx9x_4BghoC7WYQAvD_BwE) includes unlimited users, drivers and vehicles, making it a perfect choice for medium and large businesses and those aiming to scale.

The conclusion is clear - eLogii is a much more affordable and flexible solution than LogiNext Mile.

### Who is eLogii for?

Given its numerous customisation options, flexible pricing plans that include unlimited users and assets, as well as its broad range of various functionality, eLogii is an ideal solution for businesses big and small alike.

Moreover, although tools aimed at a broad market usually achieve this by having a one-size-fits-all approach, that is not the case with eLogii.

On the contrary, its overall flexibility makes eLogii more than fit to deliver unparalleled results for verticals as diverse as medical and pharmaceutical, food and drink, 3PL, couriers - and everything in between.

This is one of the things that enable eLogii to provide a standard of customer experience that the competition finds hard to match.

## LogiNext Mile alternative #2 - Bringg: For enterprises looking to manage the entire supply chain

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - Bringg UI](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-bringg-ui.JPG "LogiNext Mile Alternative - Bringg UI")

Bringg was founded in 2013 to help big retailers compete with Amazon

The way Bringg enables that is by orchestrating entire supply chains and logistics operations as well as by helping businesses connect with third-party logistics providers.

### How does Bringg outperform LogiNext Mile?

Firstly, Bringg provides a highly customisable customer experience.

As part of the intention to compete with Amazon, Bringg lets customers change their delivery and drop-off locations and supports BOPIS (buy online, pick up in-store).

Moreover, Bringg is just as geared towards supplier-to-warehouse logistics as towards warehouse-to-customer. That makes Bringg more than a route optimization and delivery management tool.

Bring is an entire platform dedicated to end-to-end logistics operations. As such, it can deal with high volumes of tasks and highly complex demands.

On the other hand, it’s worth knowing that Bringg has an outdated UI - similar to LogiNext Mile. In addition, whereas eLogii offers a driver mobile app that works seamlessly, Bringg’s app is often buggy and tricky to use.

Moreover, Bringg’s API can be very challenging to work with. There are inconsistencies in the documentation (e.g. “task”, “delivery”, and “order” are used interchangeably; some links are broken), the data models employed are often confusing, and a lot of the core app functionality is hard to configure. That makes integrating other technology more complex and slow to start.

### How do Bringg and LogiNext Mile compare in price?

Since it’s primarily aimed at enterprises, it doesn’t surprise that Bringg is on the more expensive end of the pricing range.

Bringg’s pricing is not made publicly available. Similarly to eLogii’s, it seems it’s based on the number of tasks (i.e. “orders”) since that’s a question you have to answer when booking a sales meeting.

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - Bringg Pricing](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-bringg-pricing.JPG "LogiNext Mile Alternative - Bringg Pricing")

However, it’s safe to assume that it’s likely to be high, primarily because of the supply chain features that come as part of the package.

Moreover, the lowest number of tasks is defined as under 30000. Given that other platforms set out with much lower numbers of 2000-3000 tasks for their starter plans, Bringg is probably much more expensive than most - including LogiNext Mile, which isn’t a bargain to begin with.

### Who is Bringg for?

Bringg is primarily aimed at large enterprises in retail, food and grocery, and healthcare. Their customers include Wal-Mart, the Co-Op, Coca-Cola, and KFC.

While Bringg has smaller customers, its services are tailored most to big businesses, where deliveries and supply chains are integrated and can use both their delivery and backend management capabilities.

Smaller firms and those primarily focused on last-mile delivery will be better off with a different platform.

## LogiNext Mile alternative #3 - Route4Me: Highly customisable solution for small businesses

Route4Me is one of the oldest route management platforms on the market today, having been around since 2009.

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - Route4Me UI](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-route4me-ui.png "LogiNext Mile Alternative - Route4Me UI")

Its vast range of native integrations and a marketplace of (rather pricey) add-ons allow lots of customisation for users who’d like to build a custom-tailored platform.

### How does Route4Me outperform LogiNext Mile?

Route4Me has an entire ecosystem of add-ons that allow users to tailor the software to fit their particular needs. These include:

* Curbside delivery
* Avoidance zones
* Ultra-high resolution map exports
* Routing for large and heavy vehicles
* Adapting routes for bad weather conditions

However, while some of these extensions are free, most of them will cost you an arm and a leg. And it’s worth remembering that some platforms - like eLogii - already offer these features as part of their standard plans rather than charge you extra for using them.

Route4Me also offers perhaps the broadest range of third-party integrations, which enhances the customisability enabled by the add-ons. However, it’s questionable just how useful some of these integrations really are (e.g. integration with Tumblr or Demio).

On the other hand, Route4Me suffers from a lack of advanced delivery management features. Since it was primarily designed with route planning in mind, Route4Me never actually became an all-around solution.

Moreover, the entry-level package omits automatic route optimisation altogether, forcing you to choose one of the pricier plans from the beginning.

### How do Route4Me and LogiNext Mile compare in price?

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - route4me price](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-route4me-price.png "LogiNext Mile Alternative - route4me price")

Since Route4Me’s starter plan omits route optimization, you’ll have to go with the more expensive plan straight away, meaning you can expect to pay at least $249 per month for only 10 drivers.

If you have a fleet larger than 10, adding every additional team member will cost you another $69 per month.

Finally, many features other route planning software include in their plans have to be paid for as add-ons, meaning that Route4Me isn’t a budget-friendly option.

### Who is Route4Me for?

Once you consider its pricing model, it’s safe to conclude that Route4Me is best fitted for **businesses with smaller numbers of vehicles**.

Moreover, given its primary focus on routing and the omission of various delivery-related features, Route4Me could be **better suited to businesses providing various on-field services** (e.g. plumbers, electricians, etc.) rather than companies oriented toward last-mile delivery.

## LogiNext Mile alternative #4 - Routific: Clean & simple platform for the smallest businesses

Routific is a simple and robust platform that makes up for its lack of advanced functionality by being very easy to set up and use.

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - Routific UI](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-routific-ui.JPG "LogiNext Mile Alternative - Routific UI")

### How does Routific outperform LogiNext Mile?

Unlike LogiNext Mile, Routific is exceedingly easy to use due to its lack of more complex functionality.

In addition, it has very flexible contracts that enable billing to be ramped up or down on a per diem basis and allows immediate cancellation.

Another advantage of Routific is that it doesn’t have a minimum number of users or assets per month, which makes it a much more affordable option than LogiNext Mile.

However, there are quite a few downsides to Routific, too, including:

* There’s no live vehicle tracking, which is a major downside, as there are no real-time rerouting or up-to-the-minute ETAs either
* Lack of advanced routing options, such as multi-day routing or return to depot functionality
* No barcode scanning in either plan
* Customer notifications are charged an extra $19 per vehicle per month

### How do Routific and LogiNext Mile compare in price?

![LogiNext Mile Alternative - routific price](/blog/uploads/loginext-mile-alternative-routific-price.png "LogiNext Mile Alternative - routific price")

Routific charges users on a per-vehicle basis, meaning it can get costly fast.

Moreover, as POD collection is only available with the Professional plan, most businesses would have to opt for that plan straight away.

And remember - customer notifications are charged extra!

However, it is still significantly cheaper than LogiNext Mile, either way you put it.

### Who is Routific for?

Its user-friendly interface, coupled with the lack of advanced functionality and the per-driver pricing, makes Routific a viable solution only for the **smallest of businesses that have small fleets and elementary needs**.

## The bottom line

LogiNext Mile is a feature-rich solution, but its price tag makes it a viable option for enterprises. Moreover, its complex UI can pose a challenge even to more experienced users, which can be a deal-breaker for those looking for a clean and simple solution.

And as far as LogiNext Mile alternatives are concerned, there are a few key takeaways:

* Bringg is a LogiNext Mile alternative primarily aimed at the biggest of the big companies, as it’s focused on managing the entire supply chain - and it has a matching price as well
* Route4Me allows customisation as it offers plenty of add-ons - but its lack of vital delivery management options and per-vehicle pricing makes it suitable for businesses with smaller fleets that deal with on-field services more than deliveries
* Routific has a very user-friendly interface coupled with only the most basic functionality. As such, it’s a good choice for micro businesses who need flexible contracts and have very modest needs
* Finally, eLogii has all the power of LogiNext Mile packed up in a platform that's straightforward and easy to use. Moreover, its endless customisation options, advanced functionality and custom-tailored pricing plans make eLogii a perfect solution for businesses of all types and sizes.
