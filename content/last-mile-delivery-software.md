Looking for a last-mile delivery software tool to streamline your operations and give you a customer service edge - but don’t know how to choose?

Then please allow us to be of service! Here are four of the best last-mile delivery software options - with detailed breakdowns of their features and our verdicts on what kind of businesses each would suit best.

## TLDR

* The quality of your last-mile delivery operations have a huge impact on costs and customer satisfaction - so dedicated software tools are vital to optimise and improve performance
* We’ve rated five of the best last-mile delivery software tools against eight essential criteria and considered their ideal use cases
* eLogii is ideal for small and large businesses alike, and offers some of the widest range of customisation options, in terms of both delivery and loading parameters and integrations
* LogiNext is an enterprise-level tool, which has a huge amount of functionality - and a price tag to match
* Onfleet is a real contender for small to medium businesses. It’s simple and easy to use, but can be prone to glitches
* Routific lacks some important functionality, but it’s a solid entry point for small businesses taking their first steps in this space

## Why you need last-mile delivery software

“Last-mile” delivery is the final step of the logistics process - the matter of getting products from the distribution centre to the customer.

The last-mile stage accounts for [53% of most business’ logistics costs](https://www.businessinsider.com/last-mile-delivery-shipping-explained?r=US&IR=T). The quality of service provided here also has a massive impact on customer satisfaction: [84% of shoppers say they would be unlikely to buy again](https://www.getconvey.com/press-d-last-mile-delivery-save-retail/) from a business that gave them a poor last-mile delivery experience.

So the stakes are high: choosing the best last-mile delivery software for your business has the potential to save you a huge amount of money.

For example, one international study found that [5.6% of all UK deliveries failed](https://postandparcel.info/93399/news/e-commerce/true-cost-implications-failed-deliveries/) and that each one cost an average of £14.33. How much would halving that failure rate save your business? Add fuels costs, driver wages, loading times, etc to the equation and you can see why smart businesses are choosing to run their delivery operations with dedicated software rather than leaving anything to chance.

## What we’re testing best last-mile delivery software against

We’re going to score each app against eight criteria:

1. Does it offer automated route optimisation?
2. Can it support on-the-go rerouting?
3. Can it generate dynamic, updating ETAs?
4. Does it provide customer notifications?
5. Can you track vehicle and package locations on a real-time basis?
6. Does it provide the full range of Proof of Delivery (POD) collection options?
7. Does it give you options for optimising vehicle loads?
8. Does it have first-class integration options?

Of course, the highest score doesn’t mean that a tool is necessarily the best last-mile delivery software for your needs. You have to balance that score against price and the use cases each one supports - so we’ve provided as much pricing data as we can, along with a final “in a nutshell” verdict.

## Best last-mile delivery software option 1: eLogii

eLogii lets despatchers create complex delivery routes with just a few clicks - taking into account a whole range of extra factors, like traffic conditions, truck restrictions, and multi-day routing for long-distance deliveries.

Drivers can use it in conjunction with Google Maps, Waze, and Here Maps - and their location tracked in real-time via GPS.

Not only does eLogii enable email and SMS communications with customers, updating them on live ETAs, it also allows task failure workflows to be automated - cutting the heavy associated costs.

It supports every major type of POD, and even allows you to define custom confirmation conditions (eg proof of age verification).

![Best last-mile delivery software - eLogii UI](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-elogii-ui.jpg "Best last-mile delivery software - eLogii UI")

Where eLogii outclasses the competition is in the range of options and conditions it supports. For example:

* Driver “skills” to match tasks to the best agents
* Vehicle multi-capacity optimisation (eg plan loads around capacity, weight, pallet number, etc)
* Custom driver start and endpoints
* Tolerances for late and early delivery

As a relatively new platform, eLogii is built with ease of use for non-specialists in mind and with a state-of-the-art API and webhooks that allow it to be integrated into any tech stack with ease. Both of these factors are often barriers for older platforms that need to adapt their offerings.

### How much does eLogii cost?

eLogii provides a custom price to each customer based on their specific needs, after a free consultation with a product expert. They will customise the platform to your needs, and you can then test it out during a pilot period if necessary.

![Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - eLogii pricing](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-elogii-pricing.jpg "Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - eLogii pricing")

They do provide some information about packages though, as per the image above - showing that pricing is based primarily on tasks per month. A Starter can expect to pay around $359 per month for 2,500 tasks, which includes unlimited users and all the most important features. But some of eLogii’s most advanced functionality is restricted to the higher tiers: [see here for a detailed comparison](https://elogii.com/plans-and-features#feature_table_section).

### eLogii: in a nutshell

eLogii is the ideal last-mile delivery software for businesses small and large alike - except for really small firms who won’t need all its features, and so would be better off with cheaper options.

Not only does it tick all of our best last-mile delivery software boxes, but it’s also extremely easy to use, it allows more customisation of route and load parameters than any of the alternatives, and it has a modern, best-of-class API and webhooks making it easy to plug into any tech stack.

![Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - eLogii verdict](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-elogii-verdict.jpg "Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - eLogii verdict")

## Best last-mile delivery software option 2: LogiNext

LogiNext Mile is the last-mile delivery platform within LogiNext’s wider logistics software suits. This gives it a few extra capabilities versus the stand-alone alternatives (eg odometer reading tracking via the TrackNext app).

In terms of core functionalities, LogiNext Mile ticks nearly all the boxes:

* Automated route optimisation (and manual override), rerouting, and dynamic ETAs
* Real-time customer messaging
* Live vehicle tracking
* Comprehensive POD collection options
* API and webhook integration

![Best last-mile delivery software - LogiNext UI](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-loginext-ui.jpg "Best last-mile delivery software - LogiNext UI")

It does not provide the ability to tailor the choice of packages to specific vehicles and drivers automatically. You would have to do this manually, which can be very time-consuming with large vehicles. So we’ve knocked off a mark there compared to eLogii, which provides a lot of functionality to ensure that the routes generated can be optimised against a wide range of parameters.

LogiNext Mile is strong on analytics: it can generate a lot of reports on driver performance, payments, delays, failed attempts, etc - although advanced options are only available on the Enterprise package.

### How much does LogiNext cost?

![Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - LogiNext pricing](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-loginext-pricing.jpg "Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - LogiNext pricing")

This is really quite hard to say.

Their pricing page says $49 per month per resource, for the Advanced package - a resource being one vehicle or driver. And check out that **! There is a “web license cost” not included in that price.

As shown above, the smallest paid-for plan available is 25 resources per month - giving an entry price of $1,225 per month, plus whatever a web license costs.

But further down on the [pricing page](https://www.loginextsolutions.com/pricing/mile), it says you can have as few as 5 resources on a plan. Not only that, LogiNext gives different names to the three packages in the very next table (Basic, Premium, and Advanced; presumably corresponding to Free, Advanced (!), and Enterprise).

Confused? Yeah, us too.

### LogiNext: in a nutshell

LogiNext Mile has a lot of great features, making it one of the most powerful last-mile delivery software tools on the market. But it comes with a price tag to match, which will put it out of reach of most smaller businesses.

![Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - LogiNext Mile verdict](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-loginext-verdict.jpg "Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - LogiNext Mile verdict")

## Best last-mile delivery software option 3: Onfleet

Onfleet has a clean, simple UI and a simple pricing model which makes it very attractive to smaller firms or newcomers to this space.

In terms of features, Onfleet scores highly:

* Automated route optimisation on all but the Starter package
* Live and predictive ETAs
* SMS customer notifications (but not email - we deducted half a mark for that)
* Live vehicle tracking
* POD collection options (although barcodes are only available at the higher tiers)

![Best last-mile delivery software - Onfleet UI](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-onfleet-ui.jpg "Best last-mile delivery software - Onfleet UI")

Onfleet’s driver app offers navigation through Google Maps, Waze, or Apple Maps - plus a lot of other functionality, which makes the omission of barcode scanning on the Starter and Basic packages an odd choice.

One sign that Onfleet is intended for use by smaller firms is the emphasis put on Zapier integrations. Great if you don’t have developer resources to make use of the API or webhooks. Nevertheless, Onfleet’s API is robust, well documented, and easy to work with.

But with fewer variables to play with than eLogii, for example, the scope for developing complex integrations is less extensive. Onfleet does not allow you quite so many detailed conditions around drivers, vehicles, and service levels. It is only responsive to live traffic information in the USA as well.

Finally, quite a few reviews mention [glitches in the Onfleet driver and web apps](https://www.g2.com/products/onfleet/reviews). We haven’t experienced them ourselves, but it’s worth mentioning.

### How much does Onfleet cost?

![Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - Onfleet pricing](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-onfleet-verdict-2.jpg "Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - Onfleet pricing")

Like eLogii, Onfleet’s packages are priced first and foremost according to the number of “tasks” included per month (one task being one pickup or delivery). You can have as many drivers, vehicles, and admin users as you want and you pay an extra charge per task over and above your limit.

The Basic package (2,500 tasks) is good for small firms, but it omits barcode scanning and age verification in POD - which limits the types of business it would be suitable for. The Premium package includes those functionalities and 5,000 tasks for $799 per month.

### Onfleet: in a nutshell

Onfleet explicitly markets itself first and foremost to smaller businesses - and the ability to subcontract other Onfleet organisations is particularly handy in that respect.

It has a great range of features at the higher pricing tiers (the Starter package doesn’t even include automated route optimisation, for example).

![Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - Onfleet verdict](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-onfleet-verdict.jpg "Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - Onfleet verdict")

We’ve given Onfleet half a mark for load optimisation because, while it allows users to “consider” vehicle type and capacity, it does not give as much scope to customise as eLogii does. And beware of those glitches!

## Best last-mile delivery software option 4: Routific

As we’ll soon see, Routific doesn’t have quite the same range of features as our other contenders. It has:

* No live vehicle tracking, which means rerouting on the fly is barely possible and real-time ETAs are impossible
* No capacity for barcode scanning

Those factors weigh hard on our verdict about the platform. Without visibility over where vehicles are (Routific only tags them at their most recent delivery point), users simply don’t have the level of control necessary to be able to maximise efficiency and ensure customer satisfaction.

![Best last-mile delivery software - Routific UI](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-routific-ui.jpg "Best last-mile delivery software - Routific UI")

Nevertheless, there are some good reasons to consider Routific if you are running a very small business:

* Per vehicle pricing, without a high minimum number like LogiNext
* Very flexible contracts - enabling billing to be ramped up or down on a per diem basis, and immediate cancellation
* Route planning can have a wide variety of traffic conditions modeled in to improve ETA accuracy

If simplicity is paramount, Routific is a good option. It doesn’t have some of the advanced features that other tools offer (eg multi-day scheduling, return-to-depot, support for on-demand delivery), but it’s a solid last-mile delivery software option for businesses that wouldn’t need all the functionality of or be able to afford the other options, and that’s why we’ve included it.

### How much does Routific cost?

![Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - Routific pricing](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-routific-pricing.jpg "Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - Routific pricing")

Routific’s Essentials package excludes live delivery tracking and any POD data capture. If you want those critical features, you’ll need to opt for the $59 per month per vehicle Professional package.

Charging per vehicle per month makes Routific a good option for small businesses that operate just a handful of vehicles. But for the 25-vehicle fleet we’ve been looking at, that’s going to cost a hefty $1,425 per month.

Oh, wait! If you want to be able to send email or SMS notifications to customers, that will cost an extra $19 per month per vehicle. That takes the cost for a 25-vehicle business to $1,900 per month.

### Routific: in a nutshell

Routific is good value for small, simple businesses running a few vehicles over familiar routes that are not expecting any major surprises. But:

* Lack of live vehicle tracking seriously restricts your ability to reroute vehicles, adjust ETAs and provide dynamic notifications
* No barcode scanning, even on the Professional package
* The cost mounts up fast if your business starts to grow

![Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - Routific verdict](/blog/uploads/best-last-mile-delivery-software-routific-verdict.jpg "Best Last-Mile Delivery Software - Routific verdict")

## The Bottom Line

Any business running a delivery operation in 2022 should be using last-mile delivery software. Automated route optimisation, live package tracking, and sending out prompt notifications will almost always enable you to lower costs and improve customer satisfaction.

But what businesses should use which software tools? Here’s our final recap:

* eLogii: Businesses of any size looking for a powerful, elegant, scalable, and highly-customisable solution - 8/8
* LogiNext: Enterprises looking to optimise the performance of larger fleets - 7/8
* Onfleet: Smaller businesses that want a simple, easy-to-use, comprehensive solution - 7/8
* Routific: Small businesses that want to take advantage of that $59 per month entry price and don’t have complex requirements - 4.5/8
