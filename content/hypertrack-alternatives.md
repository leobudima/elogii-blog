If you’re a fan of building your own delivery route planning tool from scratch, you’ll have a blast with HyperTrack.

However, if this doesn’t sound like much fun, you’ll need an alternative solution.

To help you find the one delivery management platform that’s right for your use case, we’ve reviewed the three best HyperTrack alternatives. In this blog post, we’ll analyze and compare each delivery management software to HyperTrack in terms of:

* Core functionality
* Pricing
* Primary use cases

A comparison can only be complete if we see what these platforms are up against first, however. So, we’ll begin by briefly reviewing HyperTrack.

## TL;DR

* **HyperTrack is ideal for users who want to develop their own route-planning software.** However, HyperTrack doesn’t support creating sophisticated routing features or comprehensive delivery management ones.
* **eLogii is a perfect solution for businesses of various types and sizes due to its rich delivery management functionality, high customization options, and flexibility.**
* **Tookan is the best option for small companies** that need sector-specific solutions and more freedom to create their bespoke platform by picking only the features they need.
* **ElasticRoute is a very basic delivery route planning software** that can accommodate only the most elementary route planning needs of micro-businesses.

## HyperTrack – Overview

![HyperTrack Interface](/blog/uploads/hypertrack-interface.png "HyperTrack Interface")

HyperTrack is different from other [delivery route planning software](https://elogii.com/blog/route-planning-software/) we’ve reviewed because it’s not an actual delivery management platform.

HyperTrack is an API and SDK that enables you to create your own delivery route planning software – either by building an app from scratch or adding customized features to an app you already have.

### What’s good about HyperTrack?

* **You can build a bespoke solution** – This is by far the best thing about HyperTrack. If you have a team of developers and are keen on creating your very own delivery route planning software, then this tool will be a dream come true. With HyperTrack, you can choose between building an entirely new app and adding the customized features you need to a pre-existing app.

![HyperTrack Mobile app](/blog/uploads/hypertrack-mobile-app.JPG "HyperTrack Mobile app")

* It is **compatible with multiple operating systems –** From Android and iOS to Cordova and Ionic.
* It allows the **development of several route planner software features** – Including auto-assigning tasks to the nearest drivers or those with your desired skill set, creating geofences, adding geotags so you’ll have the when and where for each action, and basic route planning and vehicle tracking options.

![HyperTrack Tracking](/blog/uploads/hypertrack-tracking.JPG "HyperTrack Tracking")

### What’s not so good about HyperTrack?

* **It’s not an app but an app-building tool** – As is often the case, HyperTrack’s greatest strength can also be its downfall, depending on what you need. If you don’t have a team of developers and designers or don’t want to invest that much time, energy, and money into building a custom app, HyperTrack isn’t for you. And since there are plenty of highly customizable and ready-made solutions available on the market, creating an app isn’t a necessity.
* HyperTrack’s API documentation **could be more thorough and well-organized** – Users often complain about the documentation not being updated regularly and report gaps in the information provided.
* HyperTrack’s apps can often **glitch and have bugs** – So they’re not exactly the slickest.
* It **lacks many key operational factors and features** – For example, you can’t add POD collection methods or ensure that each load will be matched with a suitable vehicle.
* Route optimization functions are **still in beta.**
* **It’s not GDPR compliant** — This means that HyperTrack’s apps can’t be used on customers who reside in the European Union.

### How much does HyperTrack cost?

HyperTrack has a Starter plan and a Production plan, as well as the option to create a custom pricing plan for users whose bills start to exceed $1000 a month.

![HyperTrack Pricing](/blog/uploads/hypertrack-pricing.png "HyperTrack Pricing")

HyperTrack’s Starter plan is actually a free package that enables prospective users to try HyperTrack out before deciding to opt for a more advanced plan. Of course, it comes with certain limitations, as you can only use up to 100,000 events and 100 API calls each month.

HyperTrack’s paid-for plans start at $119 per month. However, you should know that this is just the starting fee. The exact price you pay will depend on the features you opt for and the number of orders you have in a given month.

Each feature is charged on a per-order basis, as you can see in the image below.

![HyperTrack Features pricing](/blog/uploads/hypertrack-features-pricing.png "HyperTrack Features pricing")

For example, advanced route optimization will cost you $0.25 per order, route planning will cost you between $0.20 and $0.80 per order, etc.

### Who is HyperTrack for?

**Businesses with an in-house developer and designer team** keen on creating their own delivery route planning software will be delighted by HyperTrack’s app-building options.

However, these businesses should know that HyperTrack doesn’t enable the development of highly-advanced and sophisticated route planner software features.

Ultimately, HyperTrack is a **good fit for the smallest businesses** that can get by with the most basic delivery route planning functions.

## HyperTrack alternative #1 – eLogii: A comprehensive delivery management solution for all businesses

![eLogii UI](/blog/uploads/elogii-ui-1.png "eLogii UI")

[eLogii](https://elogii.com/?utm_content=CjwKCAjwi8iXBhBeEiwAKbUofdQnjQahWiV5t2e0M0s0YABbge-xfy-c7ljN2m9iQ68lAqx9x_4BghoC7WYQAvD_BwE) is a dedicated last-mile delivery management and optimization platform with a wide range of cutting-edge features.

eLogii’s rich functionality enables it to easily take care of all the crucial aspects of last-mile delivery, including:

* Route planning and optimization
* Fulfilling customer delivery expectations
* Overall operational efficiency

### Why choose eLogii over HyperTrack?

Unlike HyperTrack, eLogii is a ready-made app, meaning you won’t have to worry about building a custom app from scratch.

On the other hand, eLogii is a platform with high customizability, plenty of advanced features, and options for integrating with various other systems and tools.

Some of eLogii’s strong points include:

* **Advanced routing options** – Such as **dynamic routing** (meaning that it automatically adjusts routes around unforeseen events like high traffic density, traffic jams, accidents, weather conditions, and roadblocks), **live vehicle tracking, multi-day** and **multi-depot routing** for long-distance haulage and shared fleets, and **“return to depot”** functionality for drivers to reload. Unlike HyperTrack, eLogii won’t lag when calculating routes and will quickly recalculate them if anything changes.

![eLogii Multi-depot routing](/blog/uploads/automated-last-mile-delivery-elogii-multi-depot-operations.jpg "eLogii Multi-depot routing")

* **It has a broad range of POD collection methods –** Including barcode and QR code scanning, as well as cash-on-delivery confirmation.

![eLogii – POD](/blog/uploads/elogii-pod.JPG "eLogii – POD")

* A **massive number of configurable parameters** — These ensure maximum operational efficiency. They can match tasks to particular driver skills, build tolerances for late/early deliveries into routing and timing, allow customers to change their delivery addresses or opt for BOPIS, automatically match loads to the most suitable vehicles, and more.
* Best-in-class, **thoroughly documented** [**API and webhooks**](https://api-docs.elogii.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw682TBhATEiwA9crl38-FdcvmlPsQPvzkaLG_kU23DUFytKyNn2CZXxBS7ulh6Bdoy4uGARoCR6kQAvD_BwE) – This gives you seamless integrations with your wider supply chain.

![eLogii – API](/blog/uploads/elogii-api.png "eLogii – API")

* Various methods of ensuring unparalleled customer experience – Including sending **real-time SMS and/or email notifications** from every stage of the delivery process, **real-time ETA notifications** (with updated recalculations if something changes on the road), and **live tracking of each order.**
* **Failed delivery workflows** – These instruct drivers on what to do if they can’t find the end customer at the delivery location (e.g., you can leave the package in a secure location, return the package to the depot, leave the package at the post office, etc.).

![eLogii – Failed delivery](/blog/uploads/elogii-failed-workflow.JPG "eLogii – Failed delivery")

* A seamless **driver app optimized for all operating systems** – Some of the app’s capabilities include live chat with dispatchers and customers, one-click dials, navigation, POD collection, and task overview and management.

eLogii’s cutting-edge functionality makes it a far more sophisticated solution than any app you can create with HyperTrack.

### How do eLogii and HyperTrack compare in price?

One of the things that make eLogii such a flexible and versatile solution is its pricing policy.

eLogii doesn’t have one-size-fits-all pricing packages, making it an **ideal solution for small, medium, and large businesses** alike.

eLogii’s delivery management software comes with **custom-tailored pricing plans** based on your business’s particular configuration and needs. The typical entry-level price starts at around $359 per month for 2500 tasks.

Each plan includes **unlimited users, drivers, and vehicles,** so it’s an excellent option for larger businesses or those aiming to scale.

![eLogii – pricing plan](/blog/uploads/elogii-pricing.png "eLogii – pricing plan")

You can [compare each plan’s features here](https://elogii.com/plans-and-features?utm_content=Cj0KCQjwidSWBhDdARIsAIoTVb3rzMUA0BtUIPyXleIaPk7ODhqHDEWXrpWW_HCGKoi2omXmaU7DErUaAuT1EALw_wcB) for a detailed overview of what each package includes.

### Who is eLogii for?

eLogii’s wide range of advanced features, customization options, and custom-tailored pricing plans make **eLogii the perfect choice for businesses of all types and sizes.**

eLogii’s overall flexibility allows it to deliver excellent results for companies in the medical and pharmaceutical industry, companies in the food and drink industry, couriers, and every mobile workforce in between.

Moreover, eLogii’s API and webhooks enable seamless integrations with various tools and platforms, meaning you can create a customized system for managing the wider supply chain.

The only businesses that wouldn’t benefit much from eLogii are micro-businesses with fewer than 2500 tasks per month that don’t need that many advanced features.

So, is eLogii the right choice for you?

## HyperTrack alternative #2 – Tookan: A delivery management system with industry-specific solutions

![Tookan UI](/blog/uploads/tookan-ui-2.JPG "Tookan UI")

If you’d like the freedom to choose only the route planner software features you need but don’t want to bother with coding and software development, [Tookan](https://elogii.com/blog/tookan-reviews/) could be just the tool you’re looking for.

Tookan, as part of the larger Jungleworks suite, lets you pick exactly the functionalities you need from an extensive marketplace of other Jungleworks products and a massive range of Tookan’s native add-on features.

### Why choose Tookan over HyperTrack?

* Tookan has numerous **solutions specifically designed for particular business sectors and industries** – Such as cannabis transportation, beauty parlors, waste management, [water delivery](https://elogii.com/blog/water-delivery-management-software/), furniture delivery, and flower and gift delivery.
* **Custom order forms** that plug straight into the dispatch system – This is a brilliant option for micro-businesses since they won’t have to design and integrate their forms. These forms allow customers to create and submit their orders directly. Then, they will automatically appear in your orders dashboard.

![Tookan – Forms](/blog/uploads/tookan-reviews-tookan-forms.png "Tookan – Forms")

* It has an **enormous number of extensions and add-ons** that enable you to create your bespoke solution by picking only the required features – This is especially attractive for users looking for more flexibility from their delivery management platform. Additionally, Tookan has well-documented API and webhooks that help integrate Tookan with third-party tools. All of this allows users to customize their delivery management platform to their needs without having to bother with coding.

![Tookan – Extensions](/blog/uploads/tookan-extensions.png "Tookan – Extensions")

However, it should be noted that Tookan’s greatest strength – its rich marketplace of add-ons – is also its greatest weakness.

**Most of these extensions cost extra,** and they’re not cheap either (e.g., task ETAs cost $49/month, barcode generation for POD costs $11.99/month, route optimization costs $0.12 per task, etc.).

### How do Tookan and HyperTrack compare in price?

Tookan’s pricing plans are task-based, with each including unlimited agents and vehicles.

![Tookan – Pricing](/blog/uploads/tookan-pricing.png "Tookan – Pricing")

However, Tookan will inevitably cost you much more than that. Once you add all the essential extensions you’ll need for comprehensive delivery management (e.g., route optimization, in-app driver-dispatcher messaging, ETA generation, etc.), the price of each plan will shoot up very fast.

Here are our calculations of the actual costs of Tookan’s packages (provided that you don’t exceed the number of orders you get per plan):

* Early Stage – $199.99 per month for 200 tasks
* Startup – $243.99 per month for 700 tasks
* Growth – $529.99 per month for 2000 tasks
* Standard – $1089.99 per month for 5000 tasks

If you consider only the lower-tier plans, Tookan might be a viable option. But at the top, especially once you add all the necessary extensions to the equation, Tookan is anything but affordable.

### Who is Tookan for?

Tookan’s sector-specific solutions and rich marketplace of add-ons make it appear to be a very flexible and customizable delivery management software.

In reality, only certain types of businesses can make the most of Tookan's capabilities.

**Micro-businesses with less advanced needs** and a smaller number of monthly deliveries will benefit from using **Tookan's starter plans** – especially if they're looking for an industry-specific solution.

Larger and more advanced companies, on the other hand, won’t find Tookan to be a particularly economical and scalable option.

## HyperTrack alternative #3 – ElasticRoute: A free system for basic route planning

![ElasticRoute – UI](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-routing.png "ElasticRoute – UI")

[ElasticRoute](https://elogii.com/blog/elasticroute-reviews/) is a very basic yet easy-to-navigate delivery route planning software. Its biggest advantage is its free-forever version.

What’s interesting about this tool is that it doesn’t provide actual comprehensive delivery management by itself. In order to provide users with those functionalities, ElasticRoute integrates with [Detrack](https://elogii.com/blog/detrack-reviews/) – a separate delivery management tool.

### Why choose ElasticRoute over HyperTrack?

* Its route optimization features are slightly more advanced compared to what you get with HyperTrack – If nothing else, ElasticRoute’s **routing definitely works more seamlessly**, as its platform doesn’t glitch and lag as frequently as HyperTrack’s does.
* It has **a lot of configurable operational parameters** – Such as setting up vehicle capacity, entering time, distance, and stop limits per vehicle, and adjusting vehicle priority when assigning tasks.

![ElasticRoute Optimization parameters](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-optimization-parameters.JPG "ElasticRoute Optimization parameters")

* Its **free plan includes access to other ElasticRoute features** – Including dashboard API documentation and in-house geocoding.

![ElasticRoute – Geocoding](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-geocoding.JPG "ElasticRoute – Geocoding")

On the other hand, ElasticRoute doesn’t have a native mobile app, nor does it have any delivery management options. These features are only available by connecting ElasticRoute with Detrack, which is not the most convenient of solutions.

### How do ElasticRoute and HyperTrack compare in price?

On paper, ElasticRoute has a free forever plan. However, it should be noted that it includes only one vehicle and gets you just 20 stops per route.

This means that ElasticRoute’s free package simply won’t do the trick for most businesses.

Instead, companies will have to opt for its paid-for plan to get the most out of ElasticRoute.

![ElasticRoute – Pricing](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-pricing.JPG "ElasticRoute – Pricing")

When billed monthly, ElasticRoute will cost you $29 per vehicle per month. Annual billing comes with a discount.

And should you decide to combine it with Detrack to get more than just route planner software features, you can expect to pay an additional $39 per vehicle per month.

![ElasticRoute + Detrack – Pricing](/blog/uploads/elasticroute-detrack-pricing.png "ElasticRoute + Detrack – Pricing")

ElasticRoute does offer a free trial for 14-days, so you can try it before you invest.

### Who is ElasticRoute for?

As attractive as ElasticRoute’s free version may seem at first, we have to warn you: **its free plan isn’t a good option for most businesses** because it will probably not be enough to accommodate the needs of even the smallest businesses.

Furthermore, its paid-for plans are charged on a per-vehicle basis. This makes ElasticRoute a less-than-optimal solution for medium and large businesses (i.e., any company with more than a dozen vehicles in its fleet).

However, ElasticRoute is a decent option for very small businesses that only need basic delivery route planning.

## HyperTrack alternatives – The bottom line

HyperTrack is an excellent solution for users who are interested in building a new app or upgrading their existing one.

However, if you’re not exactly keen on that idea, one of HyperTrack's alternatives could get the job done better.

Tookan is a great option for users that need extra customization and the ability to pick the features they need, but its costs quickly stack up, especially for larger companies.

ElasticRoute is a relatively budget-friendly delivery route planning software for micro-businesses, although it lacks sophisticated delivery management and route optimization features.

Finally, **businesses of all types and sizes** that need a flexible and scalable platform that includes **all the features necessary for comprehensive delivery management** in its standard offering should go for **eLogii**.
