Undoubtedly, both GetSwift and Onfleet are great delivery management software in their own right, as each has a significant number of pretty handy features.

That’s precisely why choosing between the two is no easy task, as you’d first have to analyze and then compare in detail each of these tools’:

* Overall UX
* Core functionality
* Integrations and API
* Pricing policy
* Analytics features
* Best use cases

That’s where we step in to save the day. Namely, we’ve already done all the heavy lifting for you since we have:

* Used both of these delivery management platforms during their trial period to test them out firsthand
* Interviewed at least a dozen past and current users of both Onfleet and GetSwift
* Checked out their rating and customer reviews on reputable SaaS rating websites (G2, Capterra, and GetApp)

Let’s start at the beginning – by reviewing their ease of use.

## TL;DR

* Onfleet has a more robust and easy-to-use interface, while GetSwift can get glitchy.
* Neither of the two platforms has military-grade customer support, but Onfleet’s team is more responsive than GetSwift's team.
* GetSwift has a decent set of core functions. This includes basic route optimization, customer satisfaction, and a number of configurational parameters that help users optimize their deliveries in general.
* Onfleet’s forte is the option for connecting with and managing outsourced couriers and carriers, as well as its POD collection methods and task auto-assignment.
* Both delivery management platforms have many third-party integrations and thorough API documentation.
* Onfleet outrides GetSwift when it comes to analytics, as it provides separate reports for drivers and fleet managers.
* GetSwift doesn’t have any upfront costs or packages, as it charges users on a per-task basis. Onfleet has three packages in total, which include unlimited users since they’re also task-based.
* GetSwift is a good choice for small businesses that manage local deliveries only because it lacks advanced routing options and per-task pricing.
* Onfleet is best suited for small companies that outsource at least some of their deliveries.
* Larger businesses and companies looking for a more comprehensive delivery management solution will be better off with eLogii because of its numerous customization options, scalability, and advanced functionality.

## GetSwift vs. Onfleet – Ease of use

No matter how advanced a tool may be, being too complex to navigate will still put off many users.

That’s why intuitiveness and ease of use are vital categories when reviewing delivery management software.

### GetSwift

GetSwift’s interface initially seems fairly intuitive, despite the many features this tool has.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_B03NqpMtZ2I594-vkYiGKaZPBoVDFAYz5ARYwnbZN3IdFSH1OFdf1TqbyD6mYlqmWFL9omWbqgLZc8inb7rrKoqILqmiEIZLIWyuTsVUmKCq77c-gd_PHxSHSZjr3S8GELG61Uztz72c05mJeGD5F9dAl-GmqcDecigeeDqkT_hrmbga4F7ivCPQU1m1A =624x301)

GetSwift – UI

We didn’t encounter many issues while using it, but [we’ve used it for only 30 days](https://elogii.com/blog/getswift-review/).

However, a lot of GetSwift’s long-term users report quite a few problems with GetSwift’s interface. This includes:

* Notifications being late and/or inaccurate
* Compatibility problems, as its mobile app has trouble functioning on certain OS (e.g., some versions of Android)
* Custom-added features are prone to lagging

### Onfleet

[Onfleet](https://elogii.com/blog/onfleet-reviews/), on the other hand, has a clean and robust interface, which is considered one of its biggest strengths.

This makes Onfleet attractive for various users – from delivery management veterans to beginners who are just learning the ropes.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jySEjK4B5JLNNAAvBk7E3Y8RQZIDoNBYFQx5Id_5KDMnnsmtL0K6jxIxtLLKd84ieKeeW6OEyorER5Mm3614ciQq7oEAfcJNLlJ56Ra6FfBHlkznYpGTLTpHpIsUEpd4et4vIiM3lPLgFD_iN-we23FcCg8hv8dtlIcSTE9cjmaPLC5pQUtMAl6o_SQQXQ =624x359)

Onfleet – UI

### The verdict

Although both platforms have a modern and attractive design, we have to say that Onfleet’s uncluttered and easy-to-navigate interface has the edge over GetSwift’s rather buggy one.

## GetSwift vs. Onfleet – Customer service and training

In an ideal world, each system you rely on will work seamlessly 24/7. In practice, that is virtually impossible.

This is why you’ll want dedicated customer support to be there for you when you need them.

### GetSwift

GetSwift has a pretty thorough learning center with articles divided into several different categories, depending on your role (whether you’re a fleet manager, a driver, a software developer in charge of integrations, etc.).

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P8M5XLBRwbZjTkqpwh-FtZcryl4IP1juSPv9A5DO8dfP5zdFx3FZ_bvpR-QWrzp_CAhGuy2LyyMo_EgIdJfOOHRmd_XgQMZ_cH7AhknM02eijD5xlTKf2OHL_pn6FjKXsYUXBl54wUYQyLDvm6AeFdlvY0iUZBIIBB_uLViSLm_3dM17O2d0PIQQlmU9 =624x291)

GetSwift – Help center

However, GetSwift’s customer support is one of its weakest points, as it’s often unavailable and unresponsive. In fact, it has a very low score on Capterra – a miserable [3.3 out of 5](https://www.capterra.co.uk/software/145621/getswift#reviews).

And once you consider that this delivery management platform is prone to glitches of all kinds, a lack of appropriate support can quickly become a serious problem.

### Onfleet

Like GetSwift, Onfleet has a comprehensive support center with carefully segmented articles that ensure a clearer overview and easier navigation.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/clIWPoEOH6h8C4uEDsP-PLjnr99AYuxBJVGb_wyu4bnBlz-XRaPI-6fnQ0X06MbvSilRVCmvUwwEO9ORqb7eWgEw1JRFK-Ku2ZHnHeve9GBziC0IWmrTyxypM9__01y3t6qweW5CRRfWWQPwpVTk7YtSmHitbBvd1e2v5T7uzaExGpITJI93ILuOg5KG =624x263)

Onfleet – Support center

However, **Onfleet doesn’t have live technical support**, which can be a problem when you encounter an urgent issue. The only way to contact the support team is via email, and then you have to wait for their response. This isn’t exactly the most time-efficient solution.

However, Onfleet does offer the option to schedule a certain number of support calls in advance per month, depending on your chosen subscription plan.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1sVOq9Z1BE2nePhmUBnPKQ4cOnaugWYyodgHO5kiTlm-gwkMiHQlPpPeUqdiN3QUbBmrd5LZxm8n5A0w7l3S3w3smkFe6WX9k4aVZqPCanmQ8jMTOM0ZKuBj6TkYvF8pL_dT29MmdOxd76cYWufbeXI1AhjvYpPQX9byROv3gW6ZdkA02UbTTHHydDWUUA =624x189)

Onfleet – Support calls

Those support calls, however, are not to be used in emergencies, as they only cover general troubleshooting, workflow suggestions and reviews, help with managing the dashboard, etc.

If you need urgent help, you’ll have to send an email and hope for the best.

### The verdict

Neither Onfleet’s nor GetSwift’s customer support is exactly A-game, given the lack of live, 24/7 support.

Still, Onfleet’s customer support team at least does its best to respond to emails promptly. In addition, users get a certain number of support calls each month as part of their package.

Therefore, Onfleet wins in this category.

## GetSwift vs. Onfleet – Key features

A delivery management platform is only as good as its functionality is.

So, paying careful attention to Onfleet and GetSwift’s core features is key to understanding which tool might fit you best.

### GetSwift

* **Routing capabilities** – GetSwift can optimize routes by considering drivers’ skills, vehicle capacity, and overall distance. Moreover, it allows vehicle live-tracking to give fleet managers and dispatchers maximum visibility. However, you should know that GetSwift lacks advanced routing options, such as dynamic route optimization and multi-day and multi-stop routing.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VoIBzCsGgqQX3sWv_zf84Z5efqQWg1Q6ihLTwZoyWckasxL7rCeLYbnJn_w1piCNhLXuXc_3i9KVMMDcB72ChEopO0hBH0rqMiffNIje2OWAh1lRtJgfDcAR2WkHIH_wcMtprajxKMTipabkdXc2Nv7mfT-cxSOdLVDzPCiKxiOFK4MDAR3Ej8sHKYv9 =553x383)

GetSwift – Routing

* **Configurable parameters** – GetSwift's configurable parameters help businesses achieve optimal efficiency with their delivery management (e.g., setting up the type, load limits and maximum capacity of each vehicle, entering drivers’ schedules to know which driver is available at any given moment, etc.).
* **Customer satisfaction features** — GetSwift offers **ETA notifications** and **live order tracking**. There is also an option for **collecting PODs**, which is [an essential feature for tackling delivery management](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-use-proof-of-delivery/) head-on. However, it only takes e-signatures and photographs.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R-nMx960bVXmKs0ykv5KF1lMBvybuYX0U8mIprqATyxO4ifWHjhs630cT0IEHMz3uXUSXGVgtZUY8U0hHnGhiwJEPMeJgFphpMED1TWxzvx9AjC1gWBnt6hb8gV5pJF5jP5wFdWjArtzpQ5ojqZHMU33QVtxi9OBEW9sFxpU5TlfcNzQv2FkaeX433Qh =380x380)

GetSwift – Customer notifications editor

### Onfleet

* **Task auto-assignment** – Onfleet pickups and deliveries can be automatically assigned to the closest driver or the driver who will have the shortest total distance to travel after being given a new task.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0u1mdVPAPTvTXt46uiZX-8nKyxoyZ3tM1YjMfzZLqKifmGrFweSDJM1MzUrPnc_g_NxJ9IfZ7ybBsYeS7UGESQDOlCnp0JCWFEHMDfDjHZzpWRt2GmshKN1Bc1QAzJlI7LsX5qrCb8l859TmaHJ4QMT1rU8UNZtE7IaRILNI1WxNfC1W5KKvfbadjFnD =343x249)

Onfleet – Task auto-assignment

* **Comprehensive POD collection methods** – Besides signatures and photos, Onfleet has barcode scanning and age verification options. However, both of these are omitted from Onfleet’s cheaper plan, and age verification is only available in the US and Canada.
* **Options for connecting your business to other companies and organizations** – This is particularly handy for users that have a mobile workforce or are looking to outsource their deliveries partially or entirely. Companies that choose Onfleet’s Enterprise plan can add as many sub-user organizations to their dashboard as they like. That way, fleet managers can monitor and organize all of their carriers (both in-house and outsourced).

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Vzw91VczeqhkYHQCyvUPM06N7GSVvCQW9FDf5pT3QRb7j1WRVXXwwYtl2XJQjqHpLJIEH9HczA-S3-27SthCUv6Hzxxyae90Bm_zQDW7hXunz0yp2J8zRwQCMemXB1kVRkHjTWVl7_3iOWJH4pl7dWXu54i_xGll_6PvEZy6zObVdYUuCQwuFjUHVVOm =501x477.94924496207636)

Onfleet – Sub-organisation adding

* **ETA customer notifications –** These can only be sent via SMS, as there are no options for sending email notifications. Notifications also cost extra.

### The verdict

It’s impossible to say which of these two delivery management platforms is better regarding their core functionality, as each has strengths and weaknesses.

Ultimately, it will all come down to what you prefer and need the most from your delivery management software.

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind when deciding:

1. GetSwift won’t provide users with advanced routing options, and it lacks comprehensive POD collection methods.
2. Onfleet doesn’t enable delivery optimization. Namely, it omits the options necessary for optimal efficiency (e.g., automatic matching of loads that require particular transportation conditions with the vehicles that can accommodate those needs, assigning tasks to drivers based on their skill set and experience, etc.). Moreover, it doesn’t have multi-channel customer notifications since it relies on SMS alone.

## GetSwift vs. Onfleet – Integrations and API

Being able to seamlessly integrate with other platforms and tools is a must-have when it comes to delivery management platforms. Last-mile delivery is only a part of the larger picture, and you’ll want options that allow you to connect all your necessary pieces into a solid operational chain.

### GetSwift

GetSwift doesn’t leave much to be desired in this category.

On top of having a well-documented API and webhooks, GetSwift also has many native integrations with various POS, eCommerce, and online ordering platforms.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I-d_0O-WazBjC32uUB84nPeS2uaGoDCmnK15sBIksmEivlNIIuW-JT76ZXV7khlhjbnFycbYGi0uC91WDxJP-npipa-H0rE4hwyrU53E7UPlkswPQvZO3_vOGDRu-TCnSi2vbD6zS_CJRkAkLNJMLkqHhtZ6NDK0FhThkAQyKtMQWmKDUqncws-4Sb3Z =616x546)

GetSwift – Integrations

This enables users to easily connect their online selling platforms with GetSwift to achieve optimal results.

### Onfleet

Onfleet also integrates with many different platforms and systems, including Shopify, Google Sheets, and Quickbooks.

Moreover, Onfleet has a well-documented API and an open-source repository where developers are free to contribute to developing Onfleet’s custom features.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Yqblbv1WGeDuWmNvz_3kG0yAsN-KsBHaRzAWgkeNP036W4nVm57U9_ghIFMiyKbBhddfdB5mdXZn5fC0SDZaMCcSHSfej3FMijT5rVIzdH44BuEaUv_2dN956KU9ZOsfql5TIxd-HCSN8ce6Sd1oDDGso4-zhkt2TCcuPm7Fxp05QTUi9QKwsOBVTmD6 =624x291)

Onfleet – API

### The verdict

GetSwift and Onfleet don’t disappoint regarding integrations and API documentation, as each has enough integrations to help businesses oversee and manage the wider supply chain.

## GetSwift vs. Onfleet – Analytics and reporting

The ability to track all the vital stats and figures will provide insight into your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

As a result, you’ll know which parts of your delivery management need improvement and which work like a well-oiled machine.

### GetSwift

GetSwift’s reporting features are spot-on, and they help you track stats on drivers’ overall performance, average delivery time, average distance traveled, etc.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iQwBfIcA3DdaWaa9tRHa3t4Ml--GKtl2faWcIaGjDl9-x85Qke5PeXvp5Dy4pt9_xqB-vu7Xchry7O4oPpEsTi2wRUGQRilztk9PMB29F491sqFX6tclax9Hd3_VF4wqXcaNTFVIwRLnnYXBGmfj7x0H3XPCOxC1DDPnZfUEpODgZCe9tESKRREy-hCL =624x380)

GetSwift – Reports

GetSwift’s analytics dashboards have views that enable you to compare drivers across multiple KPIs (e.g., number of accomplished and failed deliveries, average delivery and task accepting time, etc.).

That way, you’ll know which agents are underperforming and which excel at their job so you can take action accordingly.

### Onfleet

The great thing about Onfleet’s analytics feature is that it provides valuable stats for both drivers on the one hand and administrators and dispatchers on the other.

That way, drivers can quickly review their task history and gain insight into things like:

* A summary of time per task, distance per task, service time per task
* The percentage of tasks that were completed on time vs. delayed
* Distance and time on duty (in transit vs. idle), etc.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SmGwNf7K2jbHyDikpk2Ks3rjjDtE-lGcosHgDeqnNuLPb-wj7NNrxQl9jSYrFgN7XIatgYkUE02UzK1bG6HSj5fHC1q_K8w1jbe2bQCQ9XVU7PSagbIPy0C5EbjaAZozMwK9XaQqtTnKdy74U6Ho-hj5zbKu6I5v_ue0nTVim5TIy5lv6TLWkpDEy4Wb =205x326)

Onfleet – Driver analytics

At the same time, fleet managers, operation managers, and dispatchers can easily keep track of their team’s overall performance and every individual driver’s results. All this information is presented in one comprehensive dashboard.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3JWLRs8WV3W5W363wUsxsTurfzl748pUaI6ocuBlTtUNw2Mf2PxZRDCfi-f0OKfY-clfM1nLDYQzmUidHIPsW8nH21heMwPzWwG7lgiIjHhvHqKtG-LZ1fVnv-6289GVo4f4yoGN-0kmXvsqZe6O-Ipp7H8nwec5J4p9mg2EPqZHtDCa1Y3x0EzTvPzM =624x355)

Onfleet – Dashboard analytics report

### The verdict

Although both Onfleet and Getswift have good analytics, Onfleet has a slight advantage as it enables both drivers and managers to see their KPIs.

## GetSwift vs. Onfleet – Pricing

When choosing a delivery management platform, your budget is undoubtedly one of the most critical factors influencing your decision.

So, finding a tool that will provide the best value for money is a no-can-do-without.

### GetSwift

What makes GetSwift a particularly interesting delivery management software is its pricing policy.

GetSwift has **per-delivery pricing**, meaning it has no upfront costs or actual pricing packages.

It is billed at **0.29$ per task**, i.e., per delivery.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/m_tNcUxNb9nscWqqZ96mRxlpKw_XHOB48FsD-fCq_rhHTmk9FChPjaD0ZWeMHyXYnsfXASs08ZmI-5jTZ1oUYCINLpywRIhavBpAKh1dZF6fX9esbGq6fxO5Ak_J9i5JhlczI3MYxUdr0lNbEvWS2dot-8nqQwW-HOuxXPsdOb6LMByNFqwHg_Ra6O-how =504x491)

GetSwift – Pricing

As you can see, that price includes pretty much all of the features we’ve discussed, making GetSwift a very attractive option at first glance.

But there’s a catch.

GetSwift is a very affordable solution for **small businesses** that don’t have that many deliveries.

For example, if you own a business that does about 200 deliveries per month, the monthly costs for using GetSwift would be no bigger than $58, which is a bargain.

However, things look significantly different once you amp up the workload.

If you’re dealing with about 5000 tasks per month, a very reasonable number for medium to large businesses, expect to pay as much as $1450.

And the **costs will just keep going up as you scale**.

Moreover, this pricing policy makes GetSwift inadequate for certain types of businesses that generally deal with logistics but not always with last-mile delivery per se.

For example, suppliers that have to make several stops at vendors for pick-ups before returning the product to the warehouse would be charged for each stop. That adds up, so GetSwift doesn’t make much financial sense for these businesses.

### Onfleet

Onfleet recently revised its pricing plans, reducing its number from four to three plans and changing the monthly fee.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Yrawp0QFYBOE9ueTsSX-h8hBMULFY2GglfWr5RGwK6ZWEcUntyLjkpnbfAundYz-p8rj2ccigGvWn4jOX4RdTcuPUIrqAP_SpL4XSbS_ytaZHtRLHZyoes2oh3YhzlIkta9vJc425pn8uCN8WWBrv4l2JZKG0o3vBoMUju0koJ7n-O3vEKDO3jUqTEKdTw =624x343)

Onfleet – Pricing

Changes have also been made to each plan’s standard offering, as all the plans now have route optimization options. Before, the starter plan omitted this functionality altogether.

Some things, however, remained the same.

Onfleet’s pricing is still based on the number of tasks (i.e., deliveries or pickups) you get per month, while all plans include unlimited users.

This pricing type is a significant strong point, as it gives users more flexibility in maximizing the efficiency of their fleet than vehicle-based pricing. For example:

* If you have a mobile workforce, i.e., a partly employed vehicle or driver, platforms that charge per driver or vehicle make you pay the total price. With Onfleet, tasks can be spread unevenly across fleets.
* Platforms with per-driver pricing will charge you the same amount for adding a bicycle and a van, which can carry out more deliveries. Task-based pricing accommodates the different capabilities of different vehicle types.
* Onfleet charges a few cents per task over a user’s package quota. There’s no such flexibility with per-vehicle pricing.

On the other hand, **Onfleet offers a pretty limited number of tasks** for its price range, as you get only 2000 tasks for $500 a month.

Moreover, **all the best features, such as barcode scanning, age verification, and advanced route optimization, are reserved for higher-tier users** only.

All this makes Onfleet a less-than-ideal option budget-wise.

### The verdict

Neither of these two platforms is exactly a budget-friendly option for medium to large businesses.

However, smaller companies that don’t have too many deliveries per month could do just fine with either tool.

It should be noted, though, that while Onfleet will charge you $500 for 2000 tasks, you could expect to pay $580 for the same number of tasks in GetSwift.

So, it’s safe to say that GetSwift is the more affordable option of the two.

## GetSwift vs. Onfleet – Use cases

Most delivery management platforms are the best fit for certain types and sizes of businesses only.

Knowing what companies can benefit the most from using which software can help you find the one that’s just right for your business.

### GetSwift

Once you consider GetSwift’s essential features, shortcomings, and pricing policy, there can be only one conclusion: **GetSwift is best suited for the smallest businesses that deal with local deliveries alone.** This is because of the platform’s lack of multi-day and multi-stop routing functions.

On the other hand, large and medium businesses won’t get the same benefits from GetSwift, as it’s far from the most affordable option when you have to manage several thousand deliveries per month.

### Onfleet

Onfleet is best suited for **small businesses that don’t need many tasks per month and can manage without more advanced delivery optimization options.**

Options for subcontracting other organizations can also come in handy for **companies that often outsource at least part of their deliveries**.

On the other hand, larger businesses with more sophisticated needs will be better off with a different kind of platform altogether.

## eLogii vs. GetSwift vs. Onfleet

As we’ve seen, both GetSwift and Onfleet work best for smaller companies with a limited number of monthly tasks that don’t have to deal with complex logistics operations.

Whereas Onfleet has options for managing a more mobile workforce, GetSwift is best suited for small businesses with in-house teams that manage local deliveries alone.

So, what are you to do if your business doesn't fit into any of these categories?

Well, you could opt for [eLogii](https://elogii.com/?utm_content=CjwKCAjwi8iXBhBeEiwAKbUofdQnjQahWiV5t2e0M0s0YABbge-xfy-c7ljN2m9iQ68lAqx9x_4BghoC7WYQAvD_BwE).

eLogii has a **wide range of highly-customizable features**, making it a perfect fit for various businesses – from field service providers to retailers, pharmaceutical companies, restaurants, couriers, [food & drink delivery services](https://elogii.com/blog/food-delivery-route-optimization/), etc.

Some of its features include:

* **Cutting-edge routing functionality** – Unlike GetSwift and Onfleet, eLogii has **dynamic**, **multi-day**, and **multi-depot routing**. eLogii’s latest generation routing AI enables it to easily replan and adjust routes on the go, with consideration for various factors like traffic, weather conditions, roadblocks, etc.

eLogii – Customer notifications

* **Numerous** **customizable operational parameters** – These enable tasks like assigning more challenging routes to the most skilled agents or automating vehicle load optimization so that each vehicle is used to its fullest capacity (i.e., it matches each load to the vehicle with suitable capacity and features such as refrigeration).

eLogii – Driver profiles

* **A vast number of POD collection methods** — Including **barcode** and **QR scanning**.


* **Failed delivery workflows** – These instruct drivers what to do if they can't find the end customer at the delivery location (e.g., you can allow leaving it with a neighbor, leaving it in a secure location, returning it to the depot, etc.)

eLogii – Failed delivery workflow

* **Comprehensive analytics dashboards and reports** – These help businesses keep their finger on the pulse of their logistics operations from beginning to end.
* **A seamless driver app optimized for all operating systems** – While GetSwift’s mobile app is notoriously glitchy and incompatible with some OSs, eLogii’s app works seamlessly. Some of its capabilities include live chat with dispatchers and customers, one-click dials, navigation, POD collection, task overview and management, etc.
