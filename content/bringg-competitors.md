Thinking about opting for Bringg? Or you're looking for some other [route planning software](https://elogii.com/blog/route-planning-software/)?

Let us help you choose your new route optimisation and delivery planning software with a thorough assessment of the three best Bringg alternatives - as well as Bringg’s pros and cons.

We’ll look at eLogii, Routific, and Route4Me - and tell you what each of them is best suited for.

Or, if you want a sneak peek at our recommendations:

## TL;DR

* Bringg is best suited for big businesses - it’s most cost-effective when you’re managing huge volumes and using its integrated supply chain management features as well
* [eLogii](https://elogii.com/) is ideal for enterprises and SMEs alike and offers the widest range of options for tailoring optimisation to your business’s specific needs as standard
* [Routific](https://elogii.com/blog/routific-competitors/) is aimed at small businesses. Contract flexibility is a plus, but it’s missing some important features
* [Route4Me](https://elogii.com/blog/route4me-competitors/) has a huge range of native integrations and a marketplace of add-ons, making it extremely customisable. If you want to “build your own” bespoke solution, Route4Me has almost endless options.

## Quick Overview of Bringg

![Bringg competitors - Bringg’s logo](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-bringg-s-logo.png "Bringg competitors - Bringg’s logo")

Bringg was founded in 2013 to help big retailers compete with Amazon - either by streamlining their supply chain and delivery operations or by helping them to integrate and manage third-party, local logistics providers.

Today, Bringg is one of the big names in delivery operations, serving some of the world’s biggest brands - like Walmart and Coca-Cola - as well as mid-tier and smaller operators.

But as an early entrant into the field that has spread its efforts over a wide area, is Bringg now threatened by newer, more agile alternatives?

## Advantages of Bringg

### Advantage #1 - Focus on first-mile as well as last-mile

Bringg is just as geared towards supplier-to-warehouse logistics as it is towards warehouse-to-customer. With Bringg, individual packages can be tracked throughout their journey via barcodes - up to and including Proof of Delivery.

![Bringg competitors - Bringg’s mobile app](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-bringg-s-mobile-app.PNG "Bringg competitors - Bringg’s mobile app")

So Bringg is more than a route optimization and delivery management tool. It’s an entire platform for end-to-end logistics operations.

### Advantage #2 - Customer experience is highly customisable.

As part of the brief to compete with Amazon, Bringg lets customers change their delivery and drop-off locations and supports BOPIS (buy online, pick up instore).

And by leveraging third-party delivery business’s capacity, Bringg makes it easier to cope with peaks in demand and to scale up.

Combined with its supply chain management features, Bringg offers scope to tailor its services to almost any business’ needs.

## Shortcomings of Bringg

### Shortcoming #1 - Slow to get started

To make the most of Bringg requires a lot of setting-up, as a direct result of its comprehensive reach throughout the supply chain. That’s probably one of the reasons why there’s no free trial.

Indeed, Bringg’s all-encompassing character is reflected in the number of native integrations available (ie hardly any). When [most businesses are using upwards of 100 different SaaS products](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1233538/average-number-saas-apps-yearly/#:\~:text=Average%20number%20of%20SaaS%20apps%20used%20by%20organizations%20worldwide%202015%2D2020&text=In%202021%2C%20organizations%20worldwide%20were,by%20companies%20has%20constantly%20increased.), it seems an odd choice.

Yes, Bringg has an API but your developers may struggle to work with it. There are inconsistencies in the documentation (eg “task”, “delivery”, and “order” are used interchangeably; some links are broken), the data models employed are often confusing, and a lot of the core app functionality is hard to configure.

Compare that to - say - eLogii’s API, which is crystal clear and elegantly designed. Bringg’s API is a whole order of magnitude harder to integrate than the best tools on the market.

### Shortcoming #2 - Tired-looking UI

![Bringg competitors - Bringg’s UI](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-bringg-s-ui.jpg "Bringg competitors - Bringg’s UI")

Bringg needs a visual overhaul. It’s been out there for a long time, and compared to eLogii and Routific in particular, it looks dated, fiddly, and unattractive.

Maybe not a deal-breaker, but drivers and dispatchers have to spend a lot of time looking at that user interface!

### Shortcoming #3 - Drivers don’t like it

Bringg’s driver app has a 3.8 rating on the Google app store. Not especially low, you might think - especially given all those 5-star reviews.

![Bringg competitors - Bringg app reviews](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-bringg-app-reviews.PNG "Bringg competitors - Bringg app reviews")

Well, [we had to go back to 2019 to find a 5-star rating](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overvyoo.client&hl=en_GB&gl=US). Users of the mobile app in the last couple of years cite a lot of problems with stability, reliability of route planning, and particularly the SOS button. While everyone’s experience is unique and often not objective or fair, that’s a lot of unhappy mobile app users. Bringg also gets a [3.5 rating on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/bringg/reviews).

## Bringg Pricing

![Bringg competitors - Bringg pricing](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-bringg-pricing.jpg "Bringg competitors - Bringg pricing")

OK, we can’t tell you how much Bringg costs, because they only offer bespoke pricing after a call with a rep. What we can tell you is that it’s likely to be high:

1. Because of the supply chain features that come as part of the package, and
2. Because the lowest tier of events per month (shown above as “less than 30,000”). When you consider that Onfleet’s Enterprise package ($1,899 per month) includes only 12,500 events per month, you’ve got to think Bringg is aiming higher than that

## Bringg Recap

Bringg is more than a route optimisation solution. It’s an entire delivery orchestration suite. And as such, it is targeted first and foremost at large enterprises that can reach far down into their supply chains to find efficiencies.

That enterprise focus and what we know about the pricing model tells us that Bringg is unlikely to be a good fit for smaller businesses, businesses handling last-mile activities exclusively, or businesses that need an agile, easy-to-deploy solution.

Ironically though, Bringg’s API poses obstacles to large customers - who would need it the most. By making integration difficult and clunky, Bringg deters sophisticated users.

So what Bringg alternative should you choose if you can’t afford that, or you don’t need that, or you need something faster (and better-looking!) than that?

Let’s turn now to the best Bringg competitors, and who they’re best suited for.

## eLogii - Bringg alternative for scaling businesses and tech elegance

![Bringg competitors - eLogii](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-elogii.png "Bringg competitors - eLogii")

[eLogii](https://elogii.com/) has been designed for delivery management and route optimisation and offers an exceptional cloud-based experience that is perfect for businesses that want to scale fast.

The eLogii platform provides businesses with the flexibility to integrate into existing systems, enabling any delivery or field service use case to be facilitated now and in the future.

## Advantages of eLogii

### Advantage #1 - Massive number of configurable parameters

No other route optimisation and delivery management tool gives users so many options for customisation, as standard. For example:

* If you need to match tasks to particular driver skills
* If you need to [specify driver actions](https://elogii.com/capabilities/live-operations) on delivery and timings for those actions
* If you need to allow for traffic conditions
* If you have complex Proof of Delivery needs
* If you need to define a [hierarchy of users](https://elogii.com/capabilities/user-management) and territories
* If you build tolerances for late/early deliveries into routing and timing
* If you need to allow customers to change their delivery addresses or opt for BOPIS

All these parameters, and many more, are supported.

![Bringg competitors - eLogii configurations](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-elogii-configurations.png "Bringg competitors - eLogii configurations")

Not only that, via its best-in-class open API and webhooks, eLogii can be straightforwardly integrated into almost any tech stack. Being a relatively new product compared to the alternatives, eLogii’s API is clean and up-to-date, without the baggage that comes with multiple rewrites and evolutions over periods of years.

### Advantage #2 - Cleverly-designed user interface and learning curve

Most logistics software is ugly, clunky, and purely functional. That’s not the case with eLogii, which has been designed with the latest in SaaS best practice in mind to deliver an experience that many customers compare to Slack.

It has also been built with non-expert users in mind, so that - despite its vast range of options and functions - eLogii is simple for anyone to learn, whether they have a background in logistics or fleet management or not.

![Bringg competitors - eLogii is easy to use](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-elogii-is-easy-to-use.jpg "Bringg competitors - eLogii is easy to use")

### Advantage #3 - All features and unlimited drivers at every price point

As we’ll see later, Routific and Route4Me price based on the number of drivers or vehicles being supported. eLogii takes a different approach, allowing customers to manage any number of drivers and other users as standard. That makes it a highly efficient option for businesses with larger fleets that would start piling up extra costs on the other platforms.

Not only that: eLogii doesn’t restrict premium features to higher-priced packages. All its features are available to every customer, no matter what they pay.

## Shortcomings of eLogii

### Shortcoming #1 - Newer brand than the competitors

Let’s be honest: eLogii has less name recognition than these other, older alternatives.

That means there are fewer reviews for potential customers to look at - although there are some valuable [case studies here](https://elogii.com/news/). It also means that, with the package tiers and pricing having been through some adjustments, some of what has been published elsewhere about how much eLogii costs is inaccurate.

But in some ways, this is an advantage. eLogii has to compete in the market on the strength of its offering, not its name, its scale, or its history. We’ve been able to build a product that takes account of what is good - and what is not so good - about the more-established competitors.

## Shortcoming #2 - Optimised for in-house fleets

Bringg is explicitly designed to help businesses integrate their operations with third-party logistics businesses. While eLogii can handle third-party fleet use cases, it has been primarily designed with private fleets in mind.

## eLogii Pricing

eLogii doesn’t have a standard rate card any longer. Pricing is given on a company-by-company basis after a consultation with a product expert, but eLogii packages start from $359 per month.

That includes all features, plus unlimited drivers and users. The precise price is then a function of monthly events, with additional events charged at a lower rate the higher the monthly quota.

## eLogii Recap

eLogii has been designed to suit the needs of all delivery businesses, from SMEs to enterprises, to provide an exceptionally powerful suite of tools, and to deliver a first-class customer experience.

![Bringg competitors - eLogii UI](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-elogii-ui.png "Bringg competitors - eLogii UI")

It’s not ideal for micro delivery businesses, as it probably has too many features for them to get the full benefit from. But for businesses that are growing and scaling up, eLogii’s toolkit, pricing model, and algorithms make it a perfect choice.

## Routific - Bringg alternative for small businesses

![Bringg competitors - Routific](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-routific.png "Bringg competitors - Routific")

If you are responsible for a small delivery operation with a limited number of drivers, then [Routific](https://elogii.com/blog/routific-competitors/) is a flexible, budget option that does a lot of the most important things that Bringg offers.

![Bringg competitors - Routific's UI](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-routific-s-ui.jpg "Bringg competitors - Routific's UI")

## Advantages of Routific

### Advantage #1 - Super flexible contracts

Routific bills on a per month, per vehicle basis. That’s a problem if you’re managing a lot of drivers - the costs soon rack up.

However, Routific contracts can be changed or canceled at any time. If you change the number of vehicles mid-month, you’ll be charged on a pro-rata basis. That gives you huge flexibility scaling costs up or down, and you’re not locked into a long-term contract.

### Advantage #2 - Native Shopify integration

Routific makes it very straightforward to import orders from your Shopify store into their platform.

Great for small Shopify users - but if you’re on any other e-commerce platform, you’ll need to use Routific’s Platform API (available on the Professional package only) to connect your shop and delivery management tools.

### Advantage #3 - Engine API

If you want to use Routific’s algorithms for route optimization in a custom platform of your own design, they’ve got a RESTful API to incorporate their tech into your app.

Not something their typical SME customers are likely to use, but one reason to consider Routific if you’re outside that target market.

## Shortcomings of Routific

### Shortcoming #1 - No on-route driver tracking

Routific doesn’t let you see where your drivers are. Only the last delivery point on their route that they hit and their ETA at the next (and subsequent) ones.

![Bringg competitors - Routific lacks on-route driver tracking](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-routific-lacks-on-route-driver-tracking.PNG "Bringg competitors - Routific lacks on-route driver tracking")

Considering that all drivers will need GPS-enabled phones to work with the system, that’s quite an oversight - and a big negative for dispatchers.

### Shortcoming #2 - No barcode tracking of packages

Unlike most of the competitors we’re looking at, Routific doesn’t allow you to collect Proof of Delivery via barcode scanning - only signatures and photos.

That limits Routific’s value as part of a wider supply chain solution: it doesn’t offer any way to integrate with inventory management or in-warehouse tracking.

### Shortcoming #3 - Charges extra for delivery status notifications

If you want to be able to send customers automated notifications about the status of their deliveries, it’s going to set up back an extra $19 per month per vehicle - even if you want to send them via email.

Considering how widely expected this feature is, that add-on charge makes quite a dent in Routific’s apparently attractive pricing…

## Routific Pricing

![Bringg competitors - Routific pricing](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-routific-pricing.jpg "Bringg competitors - Routific pricing")

While Routific includes automatic route optimization on its Essentials package, it excludes Proof of Delivery collection and live delivery status tracking - which seriously reduces its value.

So, the realistic entry price is $59 per month - charged on a per vehicle basis. Great for a small firm, but if you have a large fleet, Routific is going to get expensive fast.

## Routific Recap

Small businesses - especially those with Shopify stores - can streamline and optimize their activities using Routific, and SMEs will certainly welcome those flexible contracts.

But if you’re scaling up rather than down, Routific’s pricing can quickly become a problem rather than an attraction.

## Route4Me - Bringg alternative for bespoke modular needs

![](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-route4me.png)

[Route4Me](https://elogii.com/blog/route4me-competitors/) is even older than Bringg! They’ve been around since 2009 and claim to be the most-used route optimisation software in the world, with over 35,000 business customers.

That accolade has been accomplished via a huge range of options, that make Route4Me useable by almost anyone, in any sector, on any IT setup.

## Advantages of Route4Me

### Advantage #1 - Route4Me Marketplace for add-ons

![Bringg competitors - Route4Me add-ons](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-route4me-add-ons.jpg "Bringg competitors - Route4Me add-ons")

There are a lot of different extras you can bolt on to Route4Me to customise exactly the features you want. The majority of these are paid for, as you can see, and that helps keep the entry price down.

On the other hand, some of the alternatives we’re looking at do a lot of these things anyway. eLogii, for example, allows you to set vehicle weight, volume, package numbers, etc as standard - rather than charging you extra for them.

### Advantage #2 - Massive range of integrations

Route4Me has out-of-the-box integrations with an exceptionally wide range of other applications.

![Bringg competitors - Route4Me native integrations](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-route4me-native-integrations.jpg "Bringg competitors - Route4Me native integrations")

That enhances the customisability enabled by the add-ons seven further. With so many native integrations, Route4Me can be plugged into even the most complex and unique of tech stacks.

### Advantage #3 - Supported on Linux

Of all the tools examined here, Route4Me is the only one that runs on the open-source operating system, Linux - as well as Windows, iOS, and as a web app. If that’s the sort of thing that matters to you, then I guess this is important!

## Shortcomings of Route4Me

### Shortcoming #1 - Route planning > delivery management

Route4Me is first and foremost a route planning tool. It claims to cater for nearly a hundred different business types - and any solution that casts its net so wide will necessarily gloss over a lot of differences.

In Route4Me’s case, that is in the depth of features relating to deliveries and customer experience - although the paid-for add-ons do help tailor the packages for particular industries.

### Shortcoming #2 - Old school looks

![Bringg competitors - Route4Me’s UI](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-route4me-s-ui.jpg "Bringg competitors - Route4Me’s UI")

See those little icons on the left of the Route4Me dashboard? Well, there’s a lot of them all over the app. And combined with the Windows-style toolbar at the top, you’re looking at a crowded UI that’s not easy to navigate.

Like Bringg, Route4Me could do with taking a look at best-in-class user interfaces from the 2020s, rather than the 2000s.

### Shortcoming #3 - Entry-level package omits automatic route optimisation

Don’t be tempted by Route4Me’s £119 ($160) per month entry price. It’s not marketed as a route optimisation tool, but just “route management”. Why? Because it doesn’t include automated route optimisation at all.

For that matter, the next tier up doesn’t include route optimisation for multi-person routes. That’s only available on the top-level Route Optimization Plus package.

## Route4Me Pricing

![Bringg competitors - Route4Me’s pricing](/blog/uploads/bringg-competitors-route4me-s-pricing.jpg "Bringg competitors - Route4Me’s pricing")

Route4Me’s entry-level package excludes automated route optimisation - so £159/month is the minimum anyone who needs this will have to pay. That covers only 10 drivers. With a larger team, it’s another £40 ($55) per extra 10. Not as bad as Routific, but still a deterrent to bigger companies.

Route4Me offers a 7-day free trial as standard.

## Route4Me Recap

With its pricing model, Route4Me is best fitted to businesses co-ordinating smaller numbers of vehicles. With fewer delivery-focused options than the competition, it may be better suited to electricians, plumbers, healthcare workers, and others that don’t need those features.

## The Bottom Line

* Bringg is good for big businesses, businesses using third-party logistics providers, and businesses that want to integrate first-mile and last-mile delivery.
* eLogii is a powerful, cloud-based offering that gives users the widest range of options and the power to integrate simply into any tech stack. It’s perfect for businesses of all sizes, except the smallest.
* Routific is better suited for small businesses, given its range of features and its pricing structure.
* Route4Me lets businesses pick and choose only the features they need, but with per driver pricing, it too can become very expensive as your business grows.
