Routeware is a fleet management solution with functions specifically designed for optimizing solid waste collection.

If you’re considering choosing this platform, first, you’ll need to know all about Routeware’s:

* Ease of use
* Core functions
* Pricing policy
* Best use cases

In this article, we’ll analyze all of these vital aspects of Routeware to give you everything you need to make a well-informed decision.

But we won't stop there. Since Routeware won’t be everyone’s ideal choice, we’ve also prepared an alternative solution.

That way, we’ll have everyone covered.

## TL;DR

* Routeware is a fleet management system focused on companies that are in the solid waste collection industry.
* Although it has a fairly robust platform, it isn’t exactly user-friendly, as it has a pretty steep learning curve and an outdated interface.
* Routeware’s strong points include automated billing and invoicing, more control for customers regarding ordering services, simplified recycling processes, and basic fleet management options (e.g., GPS tracking, driver performance tracking, dash and rear view cameras, etc.).
* Routeware is a solid option for medium and large businesses dealing with garbage collection because its features are designed for that use case only.
* Users that need a more flexible, versatile, and scalable solution should go for eLogii instead.

## Routeware reviews – Our methodology

Since Routeware doesn’t have a free trial, we couldn’t try it out personally. But we did the next best thing.

Firstly, we interviewed a number of past and current Routeware users. They gave us insight into Routeware’s strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.

Secondly, we’ve sifted through customer reviews on reputable SaaS rating websites (e.g., Capterra, G2, GetApp, etc.) to get an even clearer picture of Routeware’s capabilities.

Finally, as we’re more than well-versed in the subtle art of delivery and fleet management, we know what tidbits to pay special attention to.

Now that we have that all cleared up, let’s begin by reviewing how user-friendly Routeware’s interface is.

## Routeware reviews – Ease of use

Like most platforms that focus on [fleet management](https://elogii.com/blog/benefits-of-fleet-management-systems/) first and foremost, Routeware doesn’t provide a particularly user-friendly experience. You can see what I mean below:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UzjqFkRFCLsGDq2vk6665ylM9El0uNhDUaBNUJ_EKjpe44kWPMJzpGRMCLeYWRQjw2x6WNTRsRPG1t6kmZv2blJ4j3tKuQ_P4qbLf149QhPMJpwyd9u2ZCQYn4ou3awgSaSrcCLrdenbFZH6B_bQtQXI3gf5UFDJp5E-LlFyOaxOVmdTC-VC9CWBcNOETw =624x357)

RouteWare – UI

Routeware’s wide range of functions leads to a **pretty steep learning curve**, so prospective users should brace themselves because they’ll be investing some serious effort into figuring everything out.

To make matters worse, Routeware’s interface is not easy on the eye, as it looks like it needs some updating.

Moreover, no comprehensive learning resources are available online besides a few elementary guides that won’t do inexperienced users much good.

On the other hand, Routeware’s driver apps are much more user-friendly, as they enable drivers to do everything they need with minimal effort. Routeware provides users with touch-screen tablets that can be easily installed in their vehicles. These tablets are simple to navigate.

Another upside is Routeware’s highly responsive customer support. However, there is no live chat or telephone support available – Routeware’s team relies on email alone.

### The verdict

Routeware isn’t the easiest platform to use due to its complex and outdated interface and lack of detailed learning resources.

As a result, users with little to no experience with fleet management systems will probably have quite a few issues wrapping their heads around this tool.

On the bright side, Routeware is a pretty robust solution that doesn’t go down often and isn’t prone to glitches and bugs. Routeware’s **customer support team is also very helpful and responsive**, although they currently only offer email-based support.

## Routeware reviews – Key features

### Workflow automation

Routeware enables automating several processes – from waste collection to billing and invoicing customers.

When it comes to picking up waste, there are a few things you can automate. This includes:

* **Confirming that a task has been completed thanks to its RFID reader –** Once the reader identifies that waste has been collected from a specific location, it will automatically mark that stop as completed and eliminate it from the driver’s map.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VuwZDlX0OY0JemMuBzlQeRSt07U60wWLgznXSzumcvwkA_jU6yPI48zdWImOvXC-0GC8SSSxXnO1fd0OUu2U8AxwmdvsLGuj0rOzb8v1Xm48qkAAallohWNRG1P6fJ7bAsm3wk6Cy4u3vVJrx5jAmLlMp4SncRskvEKbXnpYWcoNTRxK4NyM7ZOMhdl9HA =624x456)

Routeware – Task info

* **Taking a photo or video** – In case there’s an issue or additional proof is needed.

**Charging and invoicing customers** can also be automated to a certain extent, as Routeware automatically collects all the data necessary for billing.

For example, the weight of every collection will be measured automatically at the time of the pick-up so you can report the exact weight of each load you’ve collected and charge customers accordingly.

Moreover, you can make paying easier as customers can pay for your services online with Routeware Pay.

With Routeware Pay, customers will be able to:

* Use credit or debit cards for payments
* Opt for ACH payments
* Get an overview of their payment history, so they’ll know how much they’ve already paid and how much they still owe you

### Route optimization

[Route optimization](https://elogii.com/blog/fleet-management-route-optimization/) is a no-can-do-without when it comes to fleet management systems, and it’s no wonder why.

Namely, calculating optimal routes for your vehicles is the #1 thing that can help save time and money. Optimal routes help you manage your pickups efficiently and economically.

The Routeware routing system is based on a combination of real-world data and experience on the one hand and machine learning on the other.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/U_hgnQJuqjpAW6c-5xe-o7JOvCwvHbmIRvu6wS4YS4DN5f3RldqnH-ygLZsUFvF2Tugzk-W5A2LbjDuZUE_U62M0xfNmHy640rmJr8VriThhbYc3v6i9Pquoh9FNt8sFGHy_aEC15bIbcYYW2LkWH_4mkhcoIY5aAsmu3W1AFZ_1O5sE0avLWyRaghMpgA =624x359)

Routeware – Routing

This means that you can incorporate your drivers’ know-how and expertise into the routing system’s calculations and estimates.

That way, operation managers and dispatchers will know who to assign which task to for optimal efficiency, as well as test how different factors, like different yards, varying shift patterns, etc., influence the overall performance of their fleet.

In addition, the Routeware routing system ensures that drivers are provided with live navigation and coaching every step of the way. You can apply this on an as-needed basis.

However, the **Routeware routing system can’t efficiently tackle advanced route planning challenges**, as it cannot adapt in real time to unforeseen events and other factors that influence route optimization.

### Customer self-service

Giving customers better visibility and more control over the services you provide will make a very favorable impression on them.

Aside from enabling customers to pay for your services online, Routeware supports other options for ensuring an optimal customer experience. These options include:

* Allowing customers to check what services they’ve received – including photos as proof of work.
* Making it **easy for them to order more of your services online**. Those orders will automatically appear on your dashboard, so you’ll be able to process them faster.
* **Educating them about recycling** in a fun and engaging way by using mobile and desktop apps. As a result, not only will your job be much easier, but you’ll also make a positive long-term impact on the environment by making recycling easy, accessible, and interesting.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lQrA013RNSA0Ut4JDm1OarBiqNA7X5vXz-jJULj5aahB49YiNIsG01z4PafsCFgAalquhcrHN8jh_zU6qJxJ7u3GQiK7VHqQGXsX9tVmVYngW589MbSF0_fe5yY2DNHFd3ulgUW3pL6QyL15GmLjF5iPbtGxI0n6p2GgCpV2YiMhnYZMBXvON3NTSEXP7w =363x271)

Routeware – Recycling guide

* **Providing customers with necessary information** about your services (e.g., collection schedules, what materials are acceptable for collection, which items and materials can be recycled and how, etc.).

### Fleet management

There are a few functions Routeware supports regarding fleet management.

Like every decent fleet management system, Routeware includes devices in its offering, including cameras and touch-screen tablets you can install in your vehicles.

Cameras are essential for efficient fleet management as they ensure you’ll have proof of everything that happens on the road so you can avoid false claims and easily resolve all misunderstandings.

Routeware has a couple of cameras:

1. **A rearview camera –** This is especially handy when driving large waste collection trucks because it increases overall safety for both your drivers and pedestrians.
2. **A 360-degree vehicle-mounted camera** – this camera will record every event and take high-quality pictures from all angles.

Routeware also gives you access to its systems through onboard tablets. These tablets have:

* **GPS tracking** that shows where each vehicle is at any given moment
* **Automatic recording of each collection** (including its exact location, weight, the time when it was collected, and a reason for skipping a collection)
* **Driver performance tracking** – The data tablets collect will help you gain insight into each driver’s overall performance. This enables you to provide data-driven coaching for drivers who need it the most, as well as reward the drivers who excel at their job.
* **Live navigation and routing**

Routeware – Navigation

### The verdict

As we’ve seen in this section, Routeware supports a solid set of functions that can help simplify and optimize solid waste collection.

Features like GPS tracking, driver performance tracking, and multi-angle videos and photos enable comprehensive fleet management, whereas customer self-service and education options contribute to an excellent customer experience.

Routeware’s routing system and workflow automation features will also make the jobs of dispatchers and operations managers much easier.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind when considering Routeware:

1. Routeware’s routing system can’t compare with comprehensive [route planning software](https://elogii.com/blog/route-planning-software/). But if you don’t expect too much from Routeware, it can take care of the basics just fine.
2. Analytics reports take a lot of work to navigate and comprehend. As a result, it can be tricky to track all your KPIs with Routeware efficiently.

## Routeware reviews – How much does Routeware cost?

Routeware doesn’t publish its pricing information online, which is a common practice for fleet management software.

However, it’s fair to assume that your exact Routeware cost will depend on the number of trucks you want to manage.

One of the things prospective users have to specify when booking a consultation with the Routeware team is their fleet size, which means this factor definitely influences Routeware’s final price.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/V-nbj_iqYUtBl9A3UbV7tJT62VrwBDSXMzP4Q8kKVwrTBfCw1QZX6CYr62hKFStYQzMofr5OLn3-kGHyoINa9e_seckB9li-09OMT_1WFsz476D1aibp4SAu3X_Q1kK5Mcx_106cMhhvF6hC7VBIfeK8-u3pOFaHK9KLJJzsz5_TzNVW4RhMin3z3-9PIw =512x627)

Routeware – Quote request

We believe the final Routeware cost will probably also depend on the features you want to be included in your package.

It should also be noted that a number of users reported that **Routeware isn’t the most affordable option out there**, especially for smaller businesses.

### The verdict

Fleet management systems are rarely cheap, and Routeware is probably no exception.

We believe its exact cost is determined by a given user’s fleet size and the features they require.

If you need precise information about how much Routeware would cost for your fleet and use case, you’ll have to request a quote from the Routeware team directly.

## Routeware reviews – Who should use Routeware?

Routeware has only one use case: **it’s designed solely for users in the solid waste collection business**.

All of Routeware’s features focus on managing and optimizing the process of collecting solid waste, simplifying recycling, and automating customer invoicing and billing.

However, Routeware can’t be used as an all-around fleet management solution because it has no flexibility whatsoever.

Users needing a more versatile solution specialized for last-mile delivery management and route optimization will have to look for an alternative platform.

## Routeware reviews – Alternative solution

Businesses requiring an actual delivery management and optimization platform with versatile use cases will find that [eLogii](https://elogii.com/?utm_content=CjwKCAjwi8iXBhBeEiwAKbUofdQnjQahWiV5t2e0M0s0YABbge-xfy-c7ljN2m9iQ68lAqx9x_4BghoC7WYQAvD_BwE), with its numerous and diverse functions, could be the perfect solution.

eLogii has a **wide range of highly-customizable features,** which makes it a perfect fit for a variety of businesses – including field service providers, retailers, pharmaceutical companies, restaurants, couriers, and [food and drink delivery services](https://elogii.com/blog/food-delivery-route-optimization/).

eLogii – Vehicle configuration

* **A vast number of POD collection methods** – Including **barcode** and **QR scanning** and cash-on-delivery confirmations.


* **Failed delivery workflows** – These instruct drivers on what to do if they can’t find the end customer at the delivery location (e.g., you can allow leaving it in a secure location, returning it to the depot, leaving it at another location, etc.).

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/m7YWpPGDKf6nJkMfyaUZdJYWYKrCg3uO0o4MAOWIjTq-qvpP-NnrHc6Vf9ZDmNzkhWRSGACYEphwhvuS7ioh5H0ylCIoYxaBAvYTR2HetSTTGLAMMozfikeTeWZxVTFwet_BvnHCKxGSPdwm6qA87rk949zDvYTq6Djy6xSRup7qGATIMTFzTWaaGF6B_Q =550x456)

eLogii – Failed delivery workflow

* **A seamless** **driver app optimized for all operating systems** – Some of its capabilities include live chat with dispatchers and customers, one-click dials, navigation, POD collection, and task overview and management.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SR_0SC3u-eH-7F1YWPPUD36DeKCYgmHjNVt1acR6XIEH3oJZ_b6s4pX3csVcA5tAo6VvMA6fgzoqYUkvkzLDJgpSoh54FXzFxvTMmhjTt4tPvBdhOOOLwmXZB0qGml3FGAFjIOHKuENIqKhS-f6lmTkjisAmo8u8pE7xAvsjdDXl86nr-eXHaZrjQZO7EA =565x496)

eLogii – Driver app

* **A** [**well-documented API**](https://api-docs.elogii.com/) – So eLogii integrates seamlessly with all the other tools and technologies you use to manage your supply chain.

When it comes to its pricing, eLogii, like Routeware, doesn’t publish off-the-peg prices. Still, its pricing policy is much more straightforward than Routeware’s.

Namely, eLogii has [**custom-tailored pricing plans**](https://elogii.com/pricing?utm_content=CjwKCAjwi8iXBhBeEiwAKbUofdQnjQahWiV5t2e0M0s0YABbge-xfy-c7ljN2m9iQ68lAqx9x_4BghoC7WYQAvD_BwE) based on your business’s particular configuration and needs. The typical entry-level prices start at around $359 per month for 2500 tasks.

Each plan includes **unlimited users, drivers, and vehicles** – making eLogii an excellent option for larger businesses or those aiming to scale.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wV8954Mw3QtWjgtv9O0bgwIKz06EjpHgxGgnyxcEZLKmwOvI4lqdl8FGOaneZl0dSPPOG1h2WPJJK68Q9WyRJSNR45M7AmectV9mucxlKCKNTxdFkeDSqDggKIC2R94A3dK4GCIfUCfK_PlkwH6PimA2OhNH9_9EDKUnaDND1L9r9Eww5R1nju0FWhysew =624x264)

eLogii – Pricing

The fact that eLogii doesn’t have one-size-fits-all pricing packages is one of the things that makes it an **ideal solution for small, medium, and large businesses alike**.

You can [compare each plan’s features](https://elogii.com/plans-and-features?utm_content=Cj0KCQjwidSWBhDdARIsAIoTVb3rzMUA0BtUIPyXleIaPk7ODhqHDEWXrpWW_HCGKoi2omXmaU7DErUaAuT1EALw_wcB) on eLogii’s website for a detailed overview of what each package includes.

## Final takeaways

Routeware can be an excellent solution for medium and large companies that are in the garbage collection industry.

However, businesses that need a more versatile and adaptable platform won’t have much luck with Routeware.

Instead, they would be much better off with eLogii – an advanced delivery management system that can accommodate the needs of all businesses (despite type and size).
