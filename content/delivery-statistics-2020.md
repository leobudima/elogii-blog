Let’s dive right into it.

## General Delivery Statistics

\#1 [**15.05 billion deliveries**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/737418/parcel-traffic-worldwide-by-sector/) are completed worldwide in 2020.

\#2 [**704.7 million people**](https://www.statista.com/outlook/376/100/platform-to-consumer-delivery/worldwide) will use platform-to-consumer delivery in 2020.

\#3 The average cost of delivery is [**$6.4 per cubic meter**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/781089/parcel-delivery-costs-urban-commercial-transport/).

\#4 The average time per delivery is [**12 minutes**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/781194/day-night-parcel-delivery-time-urban-commercial-transport/).

\#5 Standard delivery takes approximately [**3-5 business days**](https://www.parcelmonkey.com/delivery-services/standard-shipping?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=df67db4aa172c01790221b0ea178619c5bea6284-1597220236-0-AWHh6ADVl5boHZWTw9roS02qq0mIzcQBS0-i6Sen0nymBZbtSVLGqdYVlIHh61NijLwGXoy8Vzyhh5lfB4dP7AIpsY0gB5DZuLNWQETLbhcvrD6kMnT93EImfozVFbq9pmMa-4GwDzOTPUQWdRdrK0UgN1ppDmCiZNe0m1wQ28QLmt-_TIJrN6iK2ooMGUWdei1FwTOdL5Jfy2TtjzcEyLUnjln1yMcGOx7bZVvy4dVULxH0jUMCRVVVhOu9yDCJqkDNJE9TJtfu3AJ-qL0CtbVbMFYSqc1NQlZFauO8tK9KypUGmSm2Dto3qyRX5lX7p4CkyzCh43aaQGPjkTthzaI8F-KfUGcmDGxOs3_7E8bjxNsbMh1alcbopTwGfIcZBSG0WwUXta5ppefbrpLUhoT69jdSyYs3IxS-v2SxkaKUridILo9C4_akMSh7uueVDKijydCHrWut6syFCvImNiWjbTjlaiwyxEpWXJ2iDZm_OT_rQoPWD_nKZa9oym15gamJyGwSjitdWEVMr2jDcVtKSR1XZiL-uufL7J4rxfgjVL8tcLyC9Xn1ejbAcyNbUhY4WZkRDG3_1EalQ0_uCRjvMTlsHKYEB_FmIy_Mt_YQ) to be completed.

\#6 [**66% of customers**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/722366/package-delivery-methods-among-millennials-worldwide/) prefer home-delivery to any other type of delivery service.

\#7 [**70% of those customers**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-transport-infrastructure/our-insights/how-customer-demands-are-reshaping-last-mile-delivery) are content with the cheapest form of home delivery option, while 23% of them would pay a premium price for same-day delivery.

\#8 [**55% of shoppers**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/720415/market-size-of-parcel-services-in-united-states-by-product-type/) in the US prefer same-day delivery to any other time of arrival.

\#9 That’s because [**58% of consumers**](https://www.usfoods.com/our-services/business-trends/2019-food-delivery-statistics.html) don’t want to wait more than 40 minutes for their deliveries to arrive.

![How long will people wait for delivery](/blog/uploads/1.jpg "How long will people wait for delivery")

\#10 It’s also why [**30% of the total market share of priority same-day delivery**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/720415/market-size-of-parcel-services-in-united-states-by-product-type/) belongs to the United States.

\#11 But, in general, nearly half, or [**44% of customers**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/561768/fast-online-order-delivery-us-consumers/) don’t mind waiting two days for their delivery to arrive.

\#12 The reason is free shipping. [**95% of consumers prefer free-one-day delivery**](https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/10/delivery-statistics.html#:\~:text=In%20fact%2C%2095%25%20of%20consumers,comes%20to%20meeting%20consumers'%20expectations.) as their ideal delivery method.

\#13 And [**48% of customers**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/482963/free-shipping-measures-of-us-shoppers/) will add more items to their shopping cart if it means they qualify for free shipping.

\#14 Companies that add a free shipping threshold can [**increase orders by 90%**](https://www.reddoor.biz/blog/case-study-rdi-a-b-testing-finds-that-adding-free/).

\#15 This will see the last mile delivery market grow to [**$91.5 billion by 2030**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1103574/autonomous-last-mile-delivery-market-size-worldwide/). A $79.5 billion rise compared to the value in 2019.

\#16 And if forecasts for 2030 are right, there will also be a [**78% increase in last-mile deliveries**](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_the_last_mile_ecosystem.pdf) in urban areas across the world.

## eCommerce and Delivery

\#17 eCommerce is driving delivery. That’s why [**10% of all retail sales**](https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-ecommerce-2019) were completed online in 2019.

\#18 At least [**82% of all global consumers**](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_the_last_mile_ecosystem.pdf) have shopped online in the previous three months.

\#19 Worldwide eCommerce retail sales will reach [**$4.9 trillion by 2021**](https://www.shopify.com/plus/guides/global-ecommerce?itcat=plusblog&itterm=global-ecommerce-statistics).

![ecommerce-sales-statistics](/blog/uploads/e-commerce-sales-2014-2021-1.png "Ecommerce sales statistics worldwide")

\#20 When it comes to online shopping, [**a survey by Nielsen**](https://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/nielsenglobal/de/docs/connected-commerce-report.pdf) suggests these are the most common items you will find at checkout:

![online-purchasing-statistics](/blog/uploads/online-purchasing-by-product-category-1.png "Online purchasing statistics")

\#21 But online shoppers in the US are willing to pay [**up to $5 for shipping**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/705977/maximum-amount-willing-to-pay-for-shipping-in-the-us/).

\#22 And this makes the last-mile worth [**approximately $115 billion**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-transport-infrastructure/our-insights/the-endgame-for-postal-networks-how-to-win-in-the-age-of-e-commerce) out of the $270 total revenue pool from eCommerce.

## Amazon Delivery

\#23 Amazon is a key player in eCommerce. That's why [**68% of all US consumers**](https://www.marketingcharts.com/industries/retail-and-e-commerce-113138) begin their search on Amazon.

\#24 It’s one of the reasons Amazon.com has been able to generate [**$280.5 billion**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266282/annual-net-revenue-of-amazoncom/) from eCommerce.

\#25 However, [**Amazon shares fell**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/technology/amazon-coronavirus-target-walmart.html) from 42% before the COVID-19 outbreak to 34% in April 2020.

\#26 But that’s not going to stop the company. Amazon has [**the largest delivery infrastructure in the world**](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_the_last_mile_ecosystem.pdf) with 390 warehouses and over 20,000 delivery vehicles.

\#27 It’s one of the reasons why it costs [**$16.2 billion**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/236503/amazons-annual-shipping-revenue-and-outbound-shipping-costs/) to run Amazon’s reverse logistics operations.

\#28 Still, [**72% of Amazon deliveries**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/05/amazon-can-already-ship-to-72percent-of-us-population-in-a-day-map-shows.html) are fulfilled within 24 hours for all of their customers.

\#29 That, and the ability to offer free shipping is why [**79.8% of shoppers**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/670499/us-amazon-usage-reason/) in the US choose Amazon. Other key factors include a broad selection of offers (68.9%), Prime membership (65.7%), and best pricing (49.2%).

![why people shop at Amazon](/blog/uploads/statistic_id670499_key-factors-for-us-users-to-shop-via-amazon-2020.jpg "why people shop at Amazon")

## Delivery Statistics by Industry

\#30 Key delivery statistics appear in every industry, including yours. For example, [**32% of the furniture**](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_the_last_mile_ecosystem.pdf) in the US will be sold online and delivered to the customers’ homes by 2023.

\#31 When it comes to food delivery, [**the sale of grocery delivery and pickup**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1120211/coronavirus-grocery-delivery-pickup-sales-us/) in the United States has grown by $6 billion from August 2019 to June 2020.

\#32 The number of orders has also increased from August 2019 to June 2020 by [**68.9 million orders**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1120235/coronavirus-grocery-delivery-pickup-orders-us/) thanks to COVID-19.

\#33 By contrast, only [**1% of total alcohol sales**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/971676/online-alcohol-sales-growth-us/) in the US are completed online.

\#34 And [**41.7% of US consumers**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1106497/likelihood-online-food-delivery-due-to-coronavirus-home-usa/) likely to purchase food online due to the Coronavirus

\#35 However, [**61% of consumers**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104915/spending-on-grocery-delivery-coronavirus-us/) don’t expect to spend more on grocery delivery due to the outbreak of COVID-19. But, 17% say they will buy more groceries online.

\#36 Nonetheless, there are [**1,231.9 million**](https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/100/online-food-delivery/worldwide) food delivery users in the world in 2020.

\#37 And in 2024, the number of platform-to-consumer delivery and restaurant-to-consumer delivery will be [**965.8 million**](https://www.statista.com/outlook/376/100/platform-to-consumer-delivery/worldwide) each.

![number of delivery users](/blog/uploads/rsz_number_of_food_delivery_users.png "number of delivery users")#38 And with a [**25% year-over-year growth**](https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/100/online-food-delivery/worldwide#market-globalRevenue), the food delivery industry will rise to $182 billion by 2024.

\#39 But it isn’t without its problems. In fact, [**70% of all customer complaints**](https://www.usfoods.com/our-services/business-trends/2019-food-delivery-statistics.html) with food delivery have to do with mismanaging the quality of service. That’s 6 out of 7 people. The most common complaints are the food isn’t warm or fresh enough (17%), the delivery is late (16%), incorrect order (12%), and that customer service ignores notes or instructions (12%).

![food delivery customer complaints](/blog/uploads/3.jpg "food delivery customer complaints")

\#40 On the other hand, 52% of delivery personnel cite food orders not being ready for pick-up as their biggest complaint.

\#41 This doesn’t prevent 79% of consumers choosing delivery over takeout if the restaurant is more than 3km away.

\#42 And even [**34% of consumers**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/705571/average-price-paid-per-food-order-in-the-us/) usually pay up to $50 per delivery when ordering food online.

\#43 That’s why [**31% of people**](https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/9-in-10-us-food-delivery-service-users-say-it-makes-their-lives-easier) in the US use third-party delivery services at least twice per week.

\#44 [**59% of third-party logistics companies**](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/06/2057928/0/en/Last-Mile-Delivery-is-the-Most-Inefficient-Process-for-More-Than-Half-of-North-American-Transportation-Logistics-Companies.html) in the US believe that last-mile delivery is the most inefficient process in their supply chain.

\#45 When it comes to healthcare and pharmacy delivery, only [**1% of the total $275 billion in revenue**](https://www.fastcompany.com/40483814/how-capsules-online-pharmacy-is-riding-the-third-wave-of-ecommerce) came from online purchases.

\#46 But by 2026, the global ePharmacy market will grow to over [**$177 billion (17.2% CAGR)**](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/epharmacy-market-100238). A rise of 643% than the current market value.

## Innovations in Delivery

\#47 [**44% of businesses**](https://www.spiceworks.com/marketing/state-of-it/report/#:\~:text=As%20revenues%20grow%2C%20IT%20budgets%20often%20increase%20in%20conjunction.&text=And%20compared%20to%202019%2C%20we,an%2018%25%20increase%20on%20average.) plan to increase their spending on technology in 2020.

\#48 [**51% of companies**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/robots-automation-social-distancing-pandemic/581531/) are willing to invest in automation due to the coronavirus, with eCommerce (66%), food and beverage (59%), and third-party logistics (55%) companies more likely to invest than others.

\#49 [**41% of supply chain professionals**](https://www.intechopen.com/books/new-trends-in-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence-for-the-industry-4-0/big-data-analytics-and-its-applications-in-supply-chain-management) say that data analysis is their top priority for tech innovation. Cloud technology and IoT follow with 39%.

\#50 46.1% of professionals are [**taking the cloud-first approach to manage delivery logistics**](https://elogii.com/blog/adopting-the-cloud-first-approach-to-delivery-logistics/).

\#51 [**37% of companies**](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-01-21-gartner-survey-shows-37-percent-of-organizations-have) have already adopted some form of AI in their day-to-day operations.

\#52 But only [**12% of supply chain professionals**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-supply-chain-mhi-report-automation/574745/) are successfully implementing AI in their operations.

\#53 [**43% of companies**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/robots-automation-social-distancing-pandemic/581531/) that adopt automation have seen significant or moderate help during the pandemic.

\#54 [**81% of supply chain professionals**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/automation-reusable-packaging-survey/579890/) also see automation as the driving force behind reusable transportation packaging.

\#55 And another 16% of last-mile delivery retailers and logistics providers mentioned [**electric vehicles**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/915755/last-mile-delivery-future-development/) among the most important next steps in the evolution of deliveries.

## Sustainable Delivery and the Environment

\#56 [**43% of shoppers**](https://www.redboxdigital.com/the-conscious-consumer-and-the-rise-of-sustainable-ecommerce/) in the UK are willing to look for an alternative if a company doesn’t offer sustainable delivery options.

\#57 [**60% of millennials shop online**](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/deloitte-2019-millennial-survey.pdf) because they believe it leaves a smaller environmental footprint.

\#58 [**49% of companies**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/mit-cscmp-lack-supply-chain-sustainability-report/581936/) have sustainable supply chain goals, but 35% of their competitors lack them completely, according to an MIT study.

\#59 [**The number of delivery vehicles**](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_the_last_mile_ecosystem.pdf) in the top 100 cities around the world will increase by 36% by 2030. As a result, emissions from delivery traffic will rise by 32% and from traffic congestion by 21%.

\#60 Innovative solutions, such as data-based connectivity, dynamic scheduling, [**route optimization**](https://elogii.com/blog/guide-to-route-optimization-software/), and load-pooling, could reduce CO2 emissions by 30%, congestion by 30%, and delivery cost by 25%.

## Delivery and Customer Experience

\#61 90% of people in the US cite customer service as a major driving force when making a decision.

\#62 [**59% of consumers**](https://www.pwc.com/future-of-cx) will never do business with a company after two or three negative experiences.

![why customers stop interacting with brand](/blog/uploads/why-customers-stop-interacting-with-brand.png "why customers stop interacting with brand")

\#63 [**96% of all customers**](https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/10/delivery-statistics.html) say customer experience is an important part of their loyalty to a brand.

\#64 [**13% of shoppers**](https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/10/delivery-statistics.html) never return for another purchase if the delivery doesn’t arrive on time.

\#65 80% of customers cite convenience, speed, knowledgeable help, and friendly service as the most important elements of good customer experience.

![what people value in customer experience](/blog/uploads/cx.jpg "what people value in customer experience")

\#66 86% of customers believe retailers should offer them the ability to choose the most convenient delivery option when ordering their goods.

\#67 47% of customers say the delivery option they want is sometimes, rarely, or never available to them.

\#68 61% of customers report that online retail companies have the delivery options that they want.

\#69 Only [**46% of direct-to-consumer brands**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/same-day-delivery-ready-for-takeoff) offer delivery options that customers want.

\#70 34% of consumers say long delivery time is the key reason to shop in physical stores instead of online.

\#71 46% of consumers abandon online shopping carts if the shipping time was too long or wasn’t provided.

\#72 [**86% of customers**](https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/) are willing to pay more for products and services, and buy more from companies that offer a great customer experience.

\#73 [**88% of consumers**](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey.html) don’t mind paying for faster delivery.

\#74 [**81% of professionals**](https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/key-findings-from-the-gartner-customer-experience-survey) say that their companies will mostly or completely compete in the future with others based on their customer experience.

## Delivery Operations Statistics

\#75 Last-mile delivery makes up [**53% of all delivery operational costs**](https://www.businessinsider.com/last-mile-delivery-shipping-explained).

\#76 Organizations with optimized supply chains have 15% lower costs than companies that don’t focus on optimization.

\#77 Only 4% of companies have an agile organization. 37% of companies have started the process of [**building an agile delivery**](https://elogii.com/blog/agile-delivery-operations/).

\#78 Key initiatives in operational optimization like delivery management platforms can [**reduce costs up to 20%**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-transport-infrastructure/our-insights/the-endgame-for-postal-networks-how-to-win-in-the-age-of-e-commerce).

\#79 The most important last-mile delivery initiative is reducing cost.

\#80 [**51% of supply chains**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/coronavirus-consumer-demand-patterns-supply-chain/580811/) see the lack of clarity on customer demand as the biggest issue stemming from COVID-19.

\#81 The most common [**KPI for delivery logistics**](https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/) monitoring is daily performance (40%), closely followed by cost reduction (35%), as well as production service rate (29%) and inventory turn (28%).

\#82 At 21.1%, [**visibility is the biggest challenge**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/829634/biggest-challenges-supply-chain/#:\~:text=A%202018%20survey%20found%20that,was%20lowest%20with%201.3%20percent.) faced by delivery and supply chain professionals.

\#83 It is closely followed by factoring consumer demand (19.7%).

\#84 [**48.4% of brick and mortar stores**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/780764/brick-mortar-store-role-supply-chain/) serve as distribution centres or depot locations within their supply chain.

\#85 53% of the total transportation cost comes from last-mile delivery.

\#86 In-store delivery pick-up had a [**554% YOY increase**](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2020/06/25/bopis-grows-more-than-500-during-pandemic/) in May 2020.

## Reverse Logistics

\#87 [**30% of all online deliveries**](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/ecommerce-product-return-rate-statistics/) are returned by customers.

\#88 By contrast, only 8.89% of purchases made in brick-and-mortar stores.

\#89 That’s 92% of customers say they will continue to do business with a company if the return process is easy.

\#90 On the other hand, 57% of consumers say returning an item is a complete hassle or the process could be easier.

\#91 That’s why 62% of customers are willing to shop at your online store if they can return an item at your physical store.

\#92 67% of shoppers also check the return policy page before checking out their item and making a purchase.

\#93 And 58% of shoppers want a no-questions-asked return policy, while 47% expect to see a return label on their purchase.

\#94 The biggest reason customers cite for returning an item is receiving the wrong item (23%).

\#95 This is followed by receiving an item that is different from their order (22%) and receiving a damaged item (20%).

\#96 79% of customers want free shipping with their return delivery, but only 49% of retail companies offer free return shipping.

\#97 If you offer them a free return with their purchase, 27% of customers are willing to spend over $1,000.

\#98 That is why [**60% of retail companies**](https://www.honeywellaidc.com/blog/2020/february/how-returns-and-reverse-logistics-can-influence-customer-brand-loyalty "brand loyalty delivery statistics") consider reverse logistics an important asset of their organization.

\#99 But only 32% have an effective solution for managing reverse logistics.

\#100 [**40% of US companies**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/872979/reverse-logistics-benefits-united-states/) report their organizations to produce less waste as a direct result of their reverse logistics operations.

\#101 72% of companies admit that they don’t have a suitable platform that can support reverse logistics operations.
