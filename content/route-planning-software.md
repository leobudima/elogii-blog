## Best route planning software #1 - eLogii

![route-planning-software-eLogii Dynamic Route Optimization](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-elogii-dynamic-route-optimization.png "route-planning-software-eLogii Dynamic Route Optimization")

eLogii is a cloud-based last-mile delivery management software that offers the **widest variety of cutting-edge features**, which makes it one of the most versatile platforms on our list.

It includes solutions that seamlessly cover all the must-have areas of contemporary delivery, such as:

* Routing;
* Customer satisfaction;
* Overall operational efficiency.

### eLogii - Pros

* Wide variety of advanced routing options - including **dynamic routing**, **multi-day**, **multi-stop** and **return to depot routing**, among others;
* **Broadest range of** [**POD collection methods**](https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-use-proof-of-delivery/), including barcode & QR code scanning, as well as cash on delivery confirmation;

![route-planning-software-eLogii POD](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-elogii-pod.JPG "route-planning-software-eLogii POD")

* **Massive number of configurable parameters** (e.g. late or early delivery tolerance, vehicle capacity optimization, driver skills to match tasks to the best agents, custom start and end points, flexible tasks and many more);
* **Live vehicle tracking**;

![route-planning-software-eLogii Live-Tracking](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-elogii-live-tracking.png "route-planning-software-eLogii Live-Tracking")

* Driver-dispatcher **live communications**;
* Performance analytics and **extensive integration options** via a [best-in-class API](https://api-docs.elogii.com/);
* **Dynamic ETA calculations** and the ability to **automate customer notifications**;

![route-planning-software-eLogii customer notifications](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-elogii-customer-notifications.JPG "route-planning-software-eLogii customer notifications")

* **Unlimited drivers, vehicles, and users on all plans,** which makes it the most easily scalable platform on the list;
* **Extensive customisation options**.

### eLogii - Cons

* One of the newest platforms in the market, so it’s not as widely recognised as some other platforms
* No free trial - but you can [book a free demo](https://elogii.com/book-demo) and explore any of its plans easily

### eLogii - Pricing

eLogii doesn’t publish off-the-peg pricing for one simple reason. Each plan is **custom-tailored** to fit a particular business’s configuration and needs perfectly.

What we can say for sure is that the typical entry-level price starts at around $359 per month for 2500 tasks.

![route-planning-software-elogii pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-elogii-pricing.png "route-planning-software-elogii pricing")

The best part? With each plan, you’ll get an unlimited number of drivers, vehicles and users.

In addition, the Starter plan includes all the most important features, so you won’t be forced to opt for one of the more expensive plans from the very beginning.

If you’re interested to see precisely what features each plan offers, you can compare them right [here](https://elogii.com/plans-and-features?utm_content=Cj0KCQjwidSWBhDdARIsAIoTVb3rzMUA0BtUIPyXleIaPk7ODhqHDEWXrpWW_HCGKoi2omXmaU7DErUaAuT1EALw_wcB).

### eLogii - Who is it for?

The conclusion is simple, given eLogii’s high customizability, its massive range of features, and flexible pricing plans that include unlimited users and vehicles.

eLogii is a good fit for **big, medium and small businesses of various types** that want one of the **most feature-rich**, **configurable** and **easily scalable** solutions on the market today.

The only businesses that wouldn’t benefit much from eLogii are micro businesses that have much less than 2500 tasks per month.

To learn more about eLogii and all of its functionalities and use cases, visit its [homepage](https://elogii.com/?utm_content=CjwKCAjwi8iXBhBeEiwAKbUofdQnjQahWiV5t2e0M0s0YABbge-xfy-c7ljN2m9iQ68lAqx9x_4BghoC7WYQAvD_BwE).

## Best route planning software #2 - Onfleet

![route-planning-software-Onfleet UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-onfleet-ui.JPG "route-planning-software-Onfleet UI")

Onfleet is a high-quality route optimisation solution for delivery businesses. Primarily used by small companies, it has a good reputation with customers and a solid selection of features.

### Onfleet - Pros

* Unlimited users and team management
* Driver tracking and analytics, displayed in real-time
* Triggered customer notifications and anonymous driver/customer communications
* Proof of delivery capture via photo and signature
* Zapier integrations

### Onfleet - Cons

* Entry-level package doesn’t include many crucial features (i.e. advanced ETAs, advanced route optimization, barcode scanning, etc.)
* Pickup or delivery status-triggered automatic SMS messages and phone communication between drivers, dispatchers and recipients are charged extra
* Pricing ramps up quickly for higher-tier plans

### Onfleet - Pricing

Onfleet pricing plans start at $500 and go up to $1150 per month, while enterprises are charged a custom price.

![route-planning-software-Onfleet Pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-onfleet-pricing.png "route-planning-software-Onfleet Pricing")

However, since Onfleet’s Launch plan omits most of the crucial features, the only logical option for a logistics manager that means business is the Scale package at $1150 per month.

Moreover, the Launch plan comes with a limit of only 2000 tasks per month, which can be an issue for all but the smallest businesses.

### Onfleet - Who is it for?

Onfleet explicitly markets itself first and foremost to smaller businesses that want a clean UI and a decent number of features.

However, its omission of some critical functionality from the starter plan makes it a good choice for **small firms that already use a lot of third-party apps to automate how they manage more complex tasks** and operations in the supply chain.

If you’re interested to **find out more about Onfleet**, we’ve analysed it in-depth in our article on [Onfleet and its 3 best competitors](https://elogii.com/blog/onfleet-competitors/).

## Best route planning software #3 - Bringg

Bringg is an Israel-headquartered business that connects, automates, and orchestrates supply chains and logistics operations.

![route-planning-software-Bringg UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-bringg-ui.JPG "route-planning-software-Bringg UI")

Its primary focus is helping big retailers by streamlining their supply chain and delivery operations or allowing them to integrate and manage third-party, local logistics providers.

### Bringg - Pros

* It manages more than last-mile delivery, as it is more aimed at end-to-end logistics operations
* It allocates a bar code to all packages that enable inventory management and tracking back in the warehouse
* Various routing features - route optimization, live tracking, etc.

### Bringg - Cons

* Outdated UI
* Prone to crashes and glitches
* The driver mobile app is buggy and difficult to use
* Low customisation options

### Bringg - Pricing

Bringg’s pricing is not made publicly available. It seems it’s based on delivery numbers, as that’s a question you have to answer when booking a sales meeting.

![route-planning-software-Bringg Pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-bringg-pricing.JPG "route-planning-software-Bringg Pricing")

However, it’s safe to assume that it’s likely to be high, primarily because of the supply chain features that come as part of the package.

Moreover, the lowest number of tasks is defined as under 30000. Given that other platforms set out with much lower numbers of 2000-3000 tasks for their starter plans, Bringg is probably much more expensive than most.

### Bringg - Who is it for?

Bringg is more than a route planning software. It’s an entire delivery orchestration suite. And as such, it is primarily targeted at **enterprises that can reach far down into their supply chains to find efficiencies**.

Smaller firms, as well as those solely oriented towards last-mile delivery and those needing a more flexible solution, will be better off with a different platform.

On a side note, we’ve **already written about** [**Bringg and its competitors**](https://elogii.com/blog/bring-competitors/) **in detail**, so if you’d like to read more about it, feel free to check it out.

## Best route planning software #4 - Routific

Routific is a simple and robust platform that makes up for its lack of advanced functionality by being very easy to set up and use.

![route-planning-software - Routific UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-routific-ui.JPG "route-planning-software - Routific UI")

### Routific - Pros

* Very flexible contracts - enabling billing to be ramped up or down on a per diem basis, and immediate cancellation
* Exceedingly easy to use
* Doesn’t have a minimum number of users per month

### Routific - Cons

* Doesn’t have live vehicle tracking, which is a major downside, as there are no real-time rerouting or up-to-the-minute ETAs either
* No advanced routing options, such as multi-day routing or return to depot functionality
* No barcode scanning in either plan
* Customer notifications are charged an extra $19 per vehicle per month

### Routific - Pricing

![route-planning-software - routific pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-routific-pricing.png "route-planning-software - routific pricing")

Routific charges users on a per-vehicle basis, meaning it can get costly really fast.

Moreover, as POD collection is only available with the Professional plan, most businesses would have to opt for that plan straight away.

And remember - customer notifications are charged extra!

### Routific - Who is it for?

Its user-friendly interface, coupled with the lack of advanced functionality and the per-driver pricing, makes Routific a viable solution only for the **smallest of businesses that have small fleets and very simple needs**.

And if you’re interested in a **more thorough analysis of Routific and its strongest competitors**, we’ve got you covered since we have a [blog about Routific and 3 of its best alternatives](https://elogii.com/blog/routific-competitors/).

## Best route planning software #5 - Tookan

![route-planning-software - Tookan UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-tookan-ui.JPG "route-planning-software - Tookan UI")

Tookan from Jungleworks is a delivery operations platform that lets you choose exactly what features you need from a massive range of add-ons and other products from the Jungleworks suite.

### Tookan - Pros

* Has an enormous number of extensions that enable you to create the perfect solution for your business
* It has sector-specific solutions for various industries (e.g. beauty, [food delivery](https://elogii.com/blog/food-delivery-route-optimization/), cannabis, waste management and others)
* There is a well-documented API and webhooks to help integrate Tookan with third-party tools

### Tookan - Cons

* Many features other platforms include in the standard plan come only as add-ons that are paid extra (e.g. route optimisation, ETAs for tasks, in-app messaging between dispatchers and drivers, custom performance reports, etc.)
* Bad customer support

### Tookan - Pricing

![route-planning-software - Tookan Pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-tookan-pricing.png "route-planning-software - Tookan Pricing")

Tookan is priced on tasks per month.

For the smallest of businesses, Tookan is exceptionally cheap - with prices starting at $29 per month for 200 tasks.

However, these are only the monthly prices for the platform itself.

Namely, Tookan treats the features most other route planning software usually include in their basic pricing plans as extensions that are charged additionally.

![route-planning-software - Tookan Extensions](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-tookan-extensions.JPG "route-planning-software - Tookan Extensions")

### Tookan - Who is it for?

Tookan’s wide range of add-on features makes it an excellent choice for businesses keen on creating their own customised solutions.

However, since all these extensions are charged extra, Tookan is a budget-friendly option **only for smaller businesses with modest needs** that can get by without most of the pricey add-ons.

We’ve written an **in-depth comparison article** on [Tookan and 4 of its best alternatives](https://elogii.com/blog/tookan-alternatives/) which will provide you with more detail.

## Best route planning software #6 - Route4Me

![route-planning-software - Route4Me UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-route4me-ui.png "route-planning-software - Route4Me UI")

Route4Me is one of the oldest route management platforms on the market today, having been around since 2009.

Its vast range of native integrations and a marketplace of (rather pricey) add-ons allow lots of customisation for users who’d like to build a custom-tailored platform.

### Route4Me - Pros

* An entire ecosystem of add-ons - of which some are free while some cost an arm and a leg - including curbside delivery, avoidance zones, routing for large and heavy vehicles, etc.
* Offers a massive range of third-party integrations (although the actual usefulness of some of them, like Tumblr or Demio, is questionable)

### Route4Me - Cons

* Lack of advanced delivery management features - this platform is focused on [route planning](https://elogii.com/blog/route-planning-strategy-100-vs-10000/) alone
* Complex and dated UI
* Entry-level package omits automatic route optimisation - in addition, many advanced features are only available as expensive add-ons

### Route4Me - Pricing

![route-planning-software - Route4Me pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-route4me-pricing.png "route-planning-software - Route4Me pricing")

Since Route4Me’s starter plan omits route optimization, you’ll have to go with the more expensive plan straight away, meaning you can expect to pay at least $249 per month for only 10 drivers.

If you have a fleet larger than 10, adding every additional team member will cost you another $69 per month.

Finally, many features that other route planning software include in their plans have to be paid for as add-ons.

### Route4Me - Who is it for?

Once you consider its pricing model, it’s safe to conclude that Route4Me is best fitted for **businesses with smaller numbers of vehicles**.

Moreover, given its primary focus on routing and the omission of various delivery-related features, Route4Me could be **better suited to businesses providing various on-field services** (e.g. plumbers, electricians, etc.).

Since we’ve already **taken a closer look at** [**Route4Me and its top competitors**](https://elogii.com/blog/route4me-competitors/) in one of our earlier articles, go check it out if you’d like more information on this platform.

## Best route planning software #7 - Workwave

![route-planning-software - Workwave UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-workwave-ui.png "route-planning-software - Workwave UI")

Workwave Route Manager falls under the route optimisation and delivery management software category and has some added vehicle management functionality.

### Workwave - Pros

* Time window planning
* Supports hard-wired GPS and ELDs for telematics (which is charged extra)
* Seamless integration with other tools

### Workwave - Cons

* It’s expensive compared to the competition - it’s charged per vehicle, and the basic plan omits vital functionality (including notifications, barcode scanning, live-tracking, etc.)
* Driver GPS is not included as standard - that means that Workwave Route Manager’s entry-level package provides no real-time visibility of vehicles or drivers

### Workwave - Pricing

Workwave doesn’t provide a standard rate card for its three product tiers, but it does say that users are charged on a per-vehicle basis and that the pricing starts at $49 per month.

![route-planning-software - Workwave Pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-workwave-pricing.png "route-planning-software - Workwave Pricing")

However, given that the features you’d expect from a good route planning software only come as paid-for add-ons rather than being part of their standard offer, the actual monthly price will probably be significantly higher.

### Workwave - Who is it for?

Workwave Route Manager is viable when you need **basic fleet management capabilities and route planning combined** in a single solution.

However, expect it to be pretty expensive since it omits most of the crucial features from its standard plans and treats them as extensions that are charged extra.

Keen to [discover more about Workwave and its best alternatives](https://elogii.com/blog/workwave-alternative/) for various use cases? Check out our **blog on Workwave & 4 of its alternatives**, and you’ll find all the info you need.

## Best route planning software #8 - RoadWarrior

![route-planning-software - RoadWarrior UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-roadwarrior-ui.png "route-planning-software - RoadWarrior UI")

RoadWarrior is a basic route planning software, but it comes with a free-forever version.

In addition, its paid plans are one of the cheapest on our list while providing a decent number of features for that price.

### RoadWarrior - Pros

* Has a free version
* Its paid-for plans are very affordable for small and simple businesses
* Integrates with Fed-Ex
* User-friendly

### RoadWarrior - Cons

* No live vehicle tracking
* No options for optimising loads based on vehicle type
* No built-in customer notifications or ETA calculations
* No POD collection options
* No multi-day routing, as its most advanced plan has a limit of 200 stops on a route

### RoadWarrior - Pricing

RoadWarrior’s pricing is based on a per-driver basis and comes at $10 per month for the Pro version.

The Flex plan also starts at $10 per driver, but with an additional $10 that gives access to the online control panel for logistics managers.

![route-planning-software - RoadWarrior Pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-roadwarrior-pricing.png "route-planning-software - RoadWarrior Pricing")

Either way, regardless of your chosen plan, RoadWarrior stands out as one of the most affordable route planning software on the market.

### RoadWarrior - Who is it for?

Although it’s a bargain, RoadWarrior’s biggest downside is that it’s too basic for advanced users.

So, only the **smallest businesses that need basic route optimization** could benefit from this route planning software.

We’ve already written about [**RoadWarrior and its 4 alternatives**](https://elogii.com/blog/road-warrior-alternative/) in detail, so you can go give that piece a look.

## Best route planning software #9 - NexTraq

![route-planning-software-NexTraq UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-nextraq-ui.JPG "route-planning-software-NexTraq UI")

NexTraq is a Michelin Group company that offers cloud-based [fleet management solutions](https://elogii.com/blog/benefits-of-fleet-management-systems/) emphasising safety, ELD maintenance and IFTA compliance.

### NexTraq - Pros

* Has a dual-facing dash-cam
* NexTraq® Driver Awareness™ detects any harsh acceleration, hard braking or aggressive cornering and notifies the driver
* Fuel management options

### NexTraq - Cons

* Horrible customer support
* Primarily a fleet management system, not optimized for delivery management
* NexTraq requires a minimum one- to a three-year contract for its services

### NexTraq - Pricing

NexTraq doesn’t list its pricing information on its website, so you’ll have to reach out to its sales reps to get an actual quote.

### NexTraq - Who is it for?

NexTraq primarily focuses on fleet management rather than route planning, even though some of its features (e.g. live vehicle tracking) enable routing as well.

That means that **businesses whose primary concern is driver safety, legislation compliance, and fuel management** could find NexTraq a good choice.

However, their unclear pricing policy and required minimum of at least one year’s use of the software make NexTraq a viable option only for businesses ready to make such a commitment right off the bat.

To get a better overview of NexTraq - and its 3 best alternatives - **check out** [**the in-depth article we’ve written about it**](https://elogii.com/blog/nextraq-competitors/) **before**.

## Best route planning software #10 - GetSwift

![route-planning-software-GetSwift UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-getswift-ui.JPG "route-planning-software-GetSwift UI")

GetSwift is a comprehensive delivery management solution with a significant number of features that aim to accommodate all the essential requirements of contemporary [last-mile delivery logistics](https://elogii.com/blog/last-mile-delivery-logistics-solutions/).

### GetSwift - Pros

* Has lots of features with a decent number of configurable parameters (e.g. vehicle capacity, drivers’ schedules, etc.)
* Plenty integration options

### GetSwift - Cons

* Prone to glitches and technical issues
* No multi-day and multi-stop routing functionality
* Doesn’t support advanced POD collection methods - photos and signatures are all it includes

### GetSwift - Pricing

GetSwift functions on an entirely per-delivery pricing basis, and it has no upfront costs nor actual pricing packages to speak of.

It is billed at 0.29$ per task, i.e. per delivery.

![route-planning-software-GetSwift Pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-getswift-pricing.JPG "route-planning-software-GetSwift Pricing")

This type of pricing makes it very attractive to smaller businesses.

However, once you increase the workload, the costs will keep growing, which makes GetSwift a less-than-desirable solution for medium to large businesses.

### GetSwift - Who is it for?

GetSwift is best suited for **small companies that deal with** [**last-mile delivery__ **optimization **](https://elogii.com/blog/last-mile-delivery-optimization/)alone and don’t require a tool that can manage the entire supply chain.

Moreover, unlike small businesses, larger ones won’t benefit from GetSwift’s pricing, as it gets pretty costly when you manage several thousand deliveries per month.

Interested in more information on GetSwift? We’ve **used it during the trial period** and [came back with extensive feedback on its features and use cases](https://elogii.com/blog/getswift-review/).

## Best route planning software #11 - Fleet Complete

![route-planning-software-Fleet Complete UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-fleet-complete-ui.png "route-planning-software-Fleet Complete UI")

Fleet Complete is a feature-rich fleet management system that’s supposed to ensure that a business’s delivery fleet works as efficiently, quickly, and safely as possible.

### Fleet Complete - Pros

* Dual-facing dashcam and video telematics
* An ELD device and a dedicated app for its management and reading data
* Options for vehicle tracking

### Fleet Complete - Cons

* Has an insane number of different apps you have to use to get the most out of the platform
* All of the apps are prone to glitches, lags and entering wrong data
* Lousy customer support

### Fleet Complete - Pricing

Fleet Complete does not disclose its pricing on-site nor provides a single hint on its pricing policy, so we cannot provide you with much information here.

However, some reviews mention that clients have paid [thousands of dollars for a fleet of 25 trucks](https://www.capterra.com/p/79292/Fleet-Complete/reviews/3388552/), so it’s **safe to assume that Fleet Complete isn’t exactly a bargain**.

### Fleet Complete - Who is it for?

Judging by its many shortcomings, dishonest marketing practices and a massive number of very negative customer reviews and poor ratings, it seems that Fleet Complete is a solution that looks great on paper but often falls short in practice.

However, provided its functionality does at least a part of what its team promises it can, Fleet Complete **could help US and Canada-based businesses** with **small to medium fleets that are exclusively interested in fleet management**.

We’ve gone [in-depth in analysing Fleet Complete](https://elogii.com/blog/fleet-complete-reviews/) in one of our earlier blogs, so you can look it up if you’d like to read more about the many trials and tribulations of this platform’s users.

## Best route planning software #12 - OptimoRoute

OptimoRoute is a highly customisable platform with an emphasis on route-related functionality.

![route-planning-software-OptimoRoute UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-optimoroute-ui.png "route-planning-software-OptimoRoute UI")

### OptimoRoute - Pros

* Many advanced routing options, including live tracking and rerouting, multi-day routing (still in beta), etc.
* Good analytics reports
* Weekly planning feature

### OptimoRoute - Cons

* Doesn’t incorporate live traffic data in routing and ETA calculations
* Only two methods of POD collection - and it omits barcode scanning
* Doesn’t support driver-dispatcher live-chat
* No structured processes for handling failed deliveries

### OptimoRoute - Pricing

![route-planning-software-OptimoRoute pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-optimoroute-pricing.JPG "route-planning-software-OptimoRoute pricing")

OptimoRoute charges users on a per-driver basis, meaning that the costs can get sky-high before you know it.

Moreover, there’s a cap on the number of tasks that can be planned and stored at once - which will be a significant obstacle for bigger businesses, as the limit is set at just 1,000.

### OptimoRoute - Who is it for?

**Small businesses and individuals who need route optimization first and foremost** will benefit the most from using OptimoRoute.

On the other hand, medium and large businesses with more advanced needs for overall delivery management and optimization should steer clear of OptimoRoute as its pricing policy and lack of advanced delivery-related functions make it inadequate for them.

We’ve already [reviewed OptimoRoute in detail](https://elogii.com/blog/optimoroute-reviews/) in one of our earlier blogs, as we’ve covered everything there is to it, from its UX to its functionality and use cases.

## Best route planning software #13 - Badger Maps

![route-planning-software-Badger Maps UI](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-badger-maps-ui.png "route-planning-software-Badger Maps UI")

Badger Maps is a route planning tool designed first and foremost for on-field sales reps and their managers.

### Badger Maps - Pros

* Easy to use
* Combines CRM and calendar functionality with route optimization
* Helps with finding new leads
* Includes team management features

### Badger Maps - Cons

* It cannot handle more complex logistics operations
* No live base-agent communication nor communication with clients
* No real-time agent tracking
* No customisation options

### Badger Maps - Pricing

Badger Maps are charged per user, and the initial fee doesn’t seem too high, especially regarding the starter plan.

![route-planning-software-Badger Maps Pricing](/blog/uploads/route-planning-software-badger-maps-pricing.png "route-planning-software-Badger Maps Pricing")

However, there’s a catch - or, better say, a couple.

Some features are only available if you purchase at least 20 licences, while CRM integrations are only available once you opt for an annual plan. They are charged extra, at a staggering $2940 for up to 5 licences.

### Badger Maps - Who is it for?

**Individual sales reps and small sales teams** could do well with Badger Maps, as this route planning software can definitely help with saving time and money by finding the best routes.

However, if you’d like a solution that offers actual customisation options and has more versatile use cases, Badger Maps simply won’t deliver.

We’ve gone **in-depth in analysing Badger Maps** in our [comprehensive Badger Maps review](https://elogii.com/blog/badger-maps-reviews/), which can tell you much more about its core functionality, advantages and use cases.

## Best route planning software #14 - LogiNext Mile

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GhRBVdONj35-lsfh8-YVcYg8R3vGp6zZzYd4IMTv8k6lvXgrjap2DPYxDL83p5GMRzmFXFg-KAnUwJvrDalp9gPrJWjNwwICePU7MN3FLKW6HN6vSY5V0LgoyElXzfyAvL-WIvboz0CEOWSAygOBxBWp0ubysGRkczpuFyde5bCXCHUnGPhAdPJxJg =624x351)

_LogiNext Mile UI_

LogiNext Mile is a dedicated last-mile delivery platform that’s part of LogiNext, a larger logistics management software that has several solutions in its suite.

### LogiNext Mile - Pros

* One of the most feature-rich solutions
* Advanced analytics reports - but this functionality is only available with the Enterprise plan

### LogiNext Mile - Cons

* Complex UI
* Lack of customisation options
* Doesn’t enable users to automatically optimize vehicle load, i.e. match a certain order with just the right vehicle

### LogiNext Mile - Pricing

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8PEZSlUDey-G5cdydJj7QQWTzSEEbyNbRcIZp_m01XKjMnChMXCZXAFMD1iwxIcUWRMFetjrphsJEqXHSg2Zb4DXHKB635XwWWkVJFxjs9zDNgOUfDK0_OnoAytYYWGSmABdIRyXzmS2txEdlgYSp0JjHiMEkYvwlJjjNK24izcw3kx1X4y5jTtCsg =624x329)

_LogiNext - Pricing_

There are a few problems with LogiNext’s pricing.

Firstly, their pricing page says it comes at $49 per month per resource for the Advanced package - a resource being one vehicle or driver.

However, as shown above, the smallest paid-for plan is only available at 25 resources per month minimum - giving an entry price of $1,225 per month.

Moreover, there’s a tiny-lettered disclaimer underneath informing prospective users of a “web license cost” that’s not included in that price.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/43WkwppLhN2d8Bz9ZN23mneNa0GkKhg_PNq5d6MN7VLZjGGSEQCmCrVNb34ZmrsyIvNgWlp4QpKMMjBwmC4g-CLTUN7LZs8F8kqq0ogaVIJnEWdUYQup12nQLQuU7fxLdD-Wu1dxffS6_t_zFCHSHNOXk4J8UVvO0U-hgZ4SjhpUssfv1IEvfOSAOA =523x51)

_LogiNext Mile Disclaimer_

That means the actual entry-level price is $1,225 per month, plus whatever a web license costs.

However, further down on the [pricing page](https://www.loginextsolutions.com/pricing/mile), it says you can have as few as 5 resources on a plan.

And to make matters even more baffling, LogiNext gives different names to the three packages in the very next table.

### LogiNext Mile - Who is it for?

LogiNext Mile has many versatile features, with a few omissions (e.g. vehicle load optimization), making it one of the most powerful last-mile delivery software tools available on the market.

But it comes with a price tag to match, which puts it out of reach for most smaller businesses.

That means that LogiNext Mile is a sustainable solution only for **enterprises with significant budgets and corresponding logistics demands**.

Trying to decide between LogiNext Mile and some of its competitors? We’ve [**compared LogiNext Mile with 4 best alternatives**](https://elogii.com/blog/loginext-mile-alternatives/) in detail if you need some help with choosing the right platform.

## Best route planning software #15 - OnTime 360

![OnTime 360 UI](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-ui.JPG "OnTime 360 UI")

OnTime 360 is a delivery management platform primarily aimed at couriers, messengers, and dispatchers that’s supposed to help them deal with all the challenges these services face nowadays.

### OnTime 360 - Pros

* Has a Customer Web Portal in higher-tier plans that enable shippers to create and edit their own orders
* Comes with a dim weight calculator
* Has an integration with QuickBooks that’s a convenient feature for business owners and managers that want a clearer overview of their accounting information

### Ontime 360 - Cons

* No ETA notifications
* No features for ensuring end-recipient satisfaction
* No live agent-dispatcher chat options in any plan
* Route optimization is charged extra
* No vital operational parameters that enable quicker load optimization

### OnTime 360 - Pricing

OnTime 360 looks really affordable at first.

![OnTime 360 Pricing](/blog/uploads/ontime-360-pricing.png "OnTime 360 Pricing")

However, the prices seen above are only starting prices.

Firstly, there’s **an additional $99 fee for account activation** that’s paid one-off.

Moreover, **each plan has a limited number of users**, whereas each additional user is charged **an additional $19**.

The **number of API transactions you get in a plan is also limited,** meaning that every extra 1000 transactions will be charged a $1.

Finally, if you want route optimization, you’ll have to pay more - from **$0.15 to $0.33 per optimization**.

### OnTime 360 - Who is it for?

Once you consider its pricing and its core functionality, the conclusion is simple.

Businesses that only deal with **courier and messenger services**, that have **smaller fleets** and **don’t necessarily need more advanced features** could do quite well with OnTime 360.

However, medium and larger businesses looking for an all-around delivery management solution won’t benefit from using this platform.

We’ve already written in detail about [**OnTime 360’s functionality, pricing, use cases, and adequate alternatives**](https://elogii.com/blog/ontime-360-reviews/) if you need more information about it.

## Best route planning software #16 - RouteXL

![RouteXL UI](/blog/uploads/routexl-ui.png "RouteXL UI")

RouteXL is one of the most basic route planning software in the market that has only the most elementary functionality.

That can be both an advantage and a shortcoming, depending on your needs.

### RouteXL - Pros

* It’s super easy to use
* It’s one of the most affordable platforms in the market
* It has a free forever version
* 

### RouteXL - Cons

* Its routing isn’t precise
* It has no advanced routing features whatsoever (e.g. dynamic routing, live traffic data, ETAs, etc)
* No options for all-around delivery management

### RouteXL - Pricing

RouteXL’s price is one of its biggest advantages, as it’s one of the cheapest tools on the market.

![Route XL Pricing](/blog/uploads/route-xl-pricing.JPG "Route XL Pricing")

Not only is there a free-forever plan, but its paid plans aren’t expensive at all.

Moreover, you can choose to pay per day or per month, depending on your needs.

This kind of flexibility is an excellent option for small, seasonal businesses (e.g. holiday deliveries, businesses that work only during the summer, etc.) that have occasional spikes in their workload followed by total inactivity.

### RouteXL - Who is it for?

RouteXL is a good choice for **small businesses or individuals that need only the most basic routing features**.

Moreover, since its geocoding isn’t exactly first-class, RouteXL can get the job done just fine only if you’re **working in an area you already know well**.

So, it’s the **small local businesses** that will find RouteXL to be a good fit.

We’ve done a [**piece on 3 best RouteXL alternatives**](https://elogii.com/blog/routexl-alternative/) which you can check out for more comprehensive info on this platform and its top competitors.

## Best route planning software #17: Circuit

![Circuit UI](/blog/uploads/circuit-ui.JPG "Circuit UI")

Circuit is a route planning software first and foremost that offers two separate solutions: one for individual drivers and another for teams.

### Circuit - Pros

* It’s easy to use
* Circuit for individuals is very affordable
* Circuit for teams offers options for live tracking vehicles and some POD methods

### Circuit - Cons

* No advanced routing
* No up-to-date customer notifications
* No barcode scanning
* No API
* No options for comprehensive delivery management

### Circuit - Pricing

Since Circuit has two solutions, each has a different pricing policy.

Circuit for drivers, i.e. individual users, comes at $20 per month. Moreover, if you have a route consisting of up to 10 stops, you can use Circuit for free.

![Circuit for drivers pricing](/blog/uploads/circuit-for-drivers-pricing.png "Circuit for drivers pricing")

When it comes to Circuit for teams, things are much different.

There are 3 pricing plans and neither is exactly a bargain.

![Circuit for teams pricing](/blog/uploads/circuit-for-teams-pricing.png "Circuit for teams pricing")

Each includes a (very) limited number of users - 3, 5, and 10, respectively, meaning you’ll have to pay extra for every additional user.

The exact price for adding extra users is undisclosed on Circuit’s website.

### Circuit - Who is it for?

The omission of some critical functionality makes Circuit a good choice for users that primarily need a routing platform and can get by without more sophisticated capabilities.

In addition, due to its pricing, **Circuit is a viable option only for individuals and the smallest of companies**, as any other type of users would find Circuit to be too expensive for what it has to offer.

More advanced users who’re looking for an all-around delivery management software, as well as larger businesses, probably won’t find Circuit to be a match.

For an [**in-depth review of Circuit’s features, use cases, and overall UX**](https://elogii.com/blog/circuit-review/) you can take a look at our detailed analysis of Circuit.

## Best route planning software #18: Yojee

![Yojee UI](/blog/uploads/yojee-ui.JPG "Yojee UI")

Yojee is an all-in-one delivery management platform focused on providing better control, visibility, and accountability for users in various industries.

### Yojee - Pros

* Partner management options for businesses looking to outsource their logistics operations
* Invoice generator and cost rate calculator
* Delivery optimization parameters - e.g., vehicle capacity set up, estimated service time for different orders

### Yojee - Cons

* Route optimization is charged extra - that is, it’s only included in the higher-tier plans and is treated like a separate asset from route planning features
* There are no advanced routing options available
* There are no options for barcode scanning as a method of POD collection
* Yojee doesn’t enable live voice communication between drivers and dispatchers

### Yojee - Pricing

![Yojee packages](/blog/uploads/yojee-packages.png "Yojee packages")

Yojee has 4 pricing plans. However, the prices are disclosed only for the first 3 plans.

![Yojee pricing plans](/blog/uploads/yojee-pricing-plans.png "Yojee pricing plans")

The prices that can be seen on Yojee’s website are only starting prices since the exact price for your business will depend on the precise number of tasks you’ll have per month.

Since each plan has a limited number of tasks that are included in the price, every task you have over that will be charged extra.

Moreover, route optimization (that includes routing + configurable operational parameters that ensure better efficiency) and rating and charging rates options are only available with the Dispatch plan and above.

Also, if you opt for the Dispatch plan, you’ll get route optimization for only 5 vehicles.

### Yojee - Who is it for?

Yojee’s set of features and its pricing plans make it a good choice primarily for businesses that **outsource their transportation and delivery processes**, as well as **enterprises** that need to overlook their entire supply chain.

Yojee’s price tag and the fact that they include their very best features only in the two priciest plans will keep it out of reach for many smaller companies, as well as companies with in-house delivery teams.

If you need a more [**in-depth review of Yojee’s functionality, pricing, and use cases**](https://elogii.com/blog/yojee-review/), we’ve written a blog that covers all the essentials.

## Best route planning software #19: Detrack

![Detrack UI](/blog/uploads/detrack-ui.png "Detrack UI")

Detrack is a delivery management platform that has a number of handy features, but it also comes with some very strange omissions.

### Detrack - Pros

* Contactless POD options
* Various features for ensuring customer satisfaction (e.g. notifications, delivery tracking, leaving feedback)
* Easy adding and managing various types of sub-users which is an important option for 3PL service providers

### Detrack - Cons

* Has no native routing capabilities - it relies instead on integration with ElasticRoutes, which increases its cost
* SMS customer notifications are only available through subscribing to a separate SMS provider (Twilio or Vonage)
* Has per-driver pricing

### Detrack - Pricing

At first glance, Detrack looks like a real budget option, especially once you consider that the first driver will have free forever access to all of Detrack’s features.

Besides, even Detrack’s paid-for version isn’t that expensive, as it comes at $24 per driver per month when paid monthly.

![Detrack pricing](/blog/uploads/detrack-pricing.JPG "Detrack pricing")

However, things quickly change once you consider several things.

Firstly, Detrack has no native routing options - not even the most basic ones. The only way to get routing is to integrate Detrack with ElasticRoutes, which means extra costs.

ElasticRoute doesn’t have a free forever version, which basically means that Detrack doesn’t really have a free-forever version since route optimization is an essential part of delivery management as such.

![detrack - pricing + optimization](/blog/uploads/detrack-pricing-optimization.JPG "detrack - pricing + optimization")

Moreover, since Detrack doesn’t have options for sending SMS notifications in the app itself, you’ll have to pay extra for using SMS providers like Twillio or Vonage.

### Detrack - Who is it for?

Detrack’s per-driver pricing makes it a great choice for micro-businesses, i.e. companies that have very small fleets.

In fact, individual drivers and couriers would benefit the most from using Detrack, given that there’s a free-forever version for the first driver. Of course, this is only possible for drivers that don’t need route optimization since Detrack’s standard offering doesn’t include this feature.

In addition, businesses providing 3PL services could also find Detrack to be a match due to its options for easy adding and managing various types of sub-users.

If you need **more detailed information on Detrack and its strong and weak points**, we’ve written an [in-depth review on all of that and more](https://elogii.com/blog/detrack-reviews/), so feel free to check it out.
